<FONT SIZE="+3"><B>Netscape on AlphaLinux</B></FONT>
<P>	    
     Having a usable GUI browser for Alpha Linux is something us Alpha 
Linux users have wanted for a long time. The problem lies with the 
fact there are few GUI browsers for x86 Linux, let alone our beloved 
Alpha. Netscape Communicator makes up the largest GUI browser 
user base. The problem here comes from the 64-bit unclean code that 
makes up what we call Netscape Communicator. By now you are probably 
asking if Communicator is not 64-bit clean, how did they make it for 
Tru64 UNIX? Well I'll tell you. They did it with this handy little 
compile time flag part of Compaq's compilers called taso. The taso 
flag tells the linker to force the code into the lower 31-bit memory 
address space. So what we have here is some questionable code, 
compiled with our good friend taso, that now runs on Tru64 UNIX.
<P>
     Compaq has now released Netscape Communicator 4.7 for Alpha 
Linux. The download site may be found at 
http://www.compaq.com/partners/netscape/downloads/register_nav4_Linux-
.html What you will find there is an RPM package containing both 
Netscape Communicator 4.7 and the Tru64 UNIX libraries required to run 
it on Alpha Linux. While you do have to register for the download, it 
will cost you no money and only about a minute of your time to fill 
out the form. 
<P>
     To install Netscape for RPM users simple use rpm with "-i" to 
install. For Debian users you will have to use alien to make a deb out 
of it. Alien with "-dsk" should produce the required deb, you will 
then need to install it from root ("/") as the script is sort of brain 
dead. Once you have Netscape installed, you should be able to simple 
type "netscape" from an xterm. The very first time you run Netscape 
from each user account it will give you a few error messages. These 
messages are normal they simply are telling you that the directory 
".netscape" does not exist and there are no cache directories. Simply 
clicking on "OK" will let you continue on. Communicator will then 
create a directory ".netscape" in your $home and a few configuration 
files within that directory. 
<P>
     The first thing you will probably notice is the awesome speed at 
which Communicator functions. Compared to the Window$ equivalent it is 
quite fast. I would have to say the credit belongs to Compaq's 
compiler development team. 
<P>
     Java is about the only thing which does not work. Some small Java 
applets do run correctly, but others and especially large ones will 
lock the browser up. In cases like these you will need to use your 
good friend kill with "-9" to take care of it. I highly recommend you 
disable Java all together in edit -> preferences. 
<P>
     After using Communicator for a couple of months, I like it. 
Although I really wish Java worked, but I guess having no Java is 
better then having no Communicator at all. Something I would like to 
you to take note of is that Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 (potato) has added a 
clone of the taso flag. The trick now would be getting 
Netscape/AOL/whatever to compile Communicator for us.
