	      <!-- Actual document -->

	      This document is a brief overview of existing Alpha CPUs,
	      chipsets and systems. It has something of a hardware bias,
	      reflecting my own area of expertese. Although I am an employee of
	      Digital Equipment Corporation, this is not an official statement
	      by Digital and any opinions expressed are mine and not Digital's.

	      What is Alpha? 
              </B></FONT><BR> 

	      "Alpha" is the name given to Digital's 64-bit RISC
              architecture. The Alpha project in Digital began in mid-1989,
              with the goal of providing a high-performance migration path for
              VAX customers. This was not the first RISC architecture to be
              produced by Digital, but it was the first to reach the
              market. When Digital announced Alpha, in March 1992, it made the
              decision to enter the merchant semicondutor market by selling
              Alpha microprocessors. Alpha is also sometimes referred to as
              Alpha AXP, for obscure and arcane reasons that aren't worth
              persuing. Suffice it to say that they are one and the same.

	      What is Digital Semiconductor?
              </B></FONT><BR> 
	      
	      Digital Semiconductor (DS) is the business unit within Digital
	      Equipment Corporation (Digital - we don't like the name DEC) that
	      sells semiconductors on the merchant market. Digital's products
	      include CPUs, support chipsets, PCI-PCI bridges and PCI
	      peripheral chips for comms and multimedia.

	      Alpha CPUs.
              </B></FONT><BR> 

	      There are currently 2 generations of CPU core that implement the
	      Alpha architecture:

	      <UL>
	      <LI>EV4 
	      <LI>EV5 
	      </UL>

	      Opinions differ as to what "EV" stands for (Editor's note: the
	      true answer is of course "Electro Vlassic" ``[1]''), but the
	      number represents the first generation of Digital's CMOS
	      technology that the core was implemented in. So, the EV4 was
	      originally implemented in CMOS4. As time goes by, a CPU tends to
	      get a mid-life performance kick by being optically shrunk into
	      the next generation of CMOS process. EV45, then, is the EV4 core
	      implemented in CMOS5 process. There is a big difference between
	      shrinking a design into a particular technology and implementing
	      it from scratch in that technology (but I don't want to go into
	      that now). There are a few other wildcards in here: there is also
	      a CMOS4S (optical shrink in CMOS4) and a CMOS5L.
	      <P>
	      True technophiles will be interested to know that CMOS4 is a 0.75
	      micron process, CMOS5 is a 0.5 micron process and CMOS6 is a 0.35
	      micron process.

	      <P>
	      ...and so on. Note that to create a top-level document like this,
              all you do is drop the "document title" thing above, and just go
              straight into a list of links, optionally with an introduction
              first, and explanations to each link.
