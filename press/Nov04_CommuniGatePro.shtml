MILL VALLEY, CA - November 5, 1999 - Stalker Software, Inc. today announced
the version 3.1 of their hi-end CommuniGate Pro messaging system. CommuniGate
Pro is a Unified Messaging Server which supports most major operating systems.
CommuniGate Pro is recognized for its many features, high speed and
reliability.
<P>
Since its first commercial release in September 1998, Stalker has expanded the
operating systems it supports to include HP/UX, Solaris, FreeBSD, Linux/
LinuxPPC, WindowsNT, MacOS X, BSDi, AIX, D/Unix, IRIX and now AlphaLinux. On
all platforms, CommuniGate Pro presents the same interface and uses the same
file formats, allowing any organization to switch server platforms in less
than an hour. 
<P>
<B>Scalability</B>
<P>
CommuniGate Pro can support 100,000-200,000 accounts from one server making it
a viable solution for small to mid-size ISP's. For extra large ISP's handling
millions of accounts, CommuniGate Pro offers clustering support. CommuniGate
Pro clustering can be used to build frontend/backend multi-server
configurations, as well as symmetric cluster sites. Based on inter-server
synchronization methods, the CommuniGate Pro Cluster can employ shared file
servers (such as NFS servers) without the overhead and reliability problems
associated with the OS-level file locking.  
<P>
<B>Personal Web Pages</B>
<P>
In addition, the new 3.1 version of CommuniGate Pro supports Personal Web
Sites with automated publishing. Users can create their own Web sites and
upload web files to the CommuniGate Pro server using any composer application
that supports the HTTP PUT method (like Netscape(r) Composer). Besides,
Personal Web Sites can be updated using simple HTML forms. Support for
uploading via the CommuniGate Pro FTP server should follow in the next
release.
<P>
<B>Security</B>
<P>
CommuniGate Pro supports secure connections for all services it supports. Not
only the HTTP services (Web Administration and WebUser interface to E-mail)
can be used via secure internet connections, but all other communications,
such as IMAP, POP, SMTP, LDAP, ACAP can be secured.
<P> 
<B>Anti-Spam Features </B>
<P>
Stalker Software is known for the sophisticated Anti-Spam features in their
current mail servers, and CommuniGate Pro is no exception. These features
include: restricted relaying, black-listing IP addresses, domains and
individual accounts; return-path verification, and support for DNS-based
black-list servers (RBLs). In addition, CommuniGate Pro now supports the
highly effective Spam Trap feature created for the Stalker Internet Mail
Server. By creating a fictitious, "spam-trap" account with CommuniGate Pro,
the bulk mailing lists that use robots to scan and gather email addresses from
web pages will pick up this fictitious account for their list. Any email
coming into the server addressed to the "spam-trap" account will allow the
Server to reject the entire messages, and they will not be delivered to any
real recipient on your site either.
<P>
<B>Try Before You Buy</B>
<P>
CommuniGate Pro is marketed in the same manner as the CommuniGate System for
the MacOS. There is a Free Trial Version available at <http://www.stalker.com/
CommuniGatePro/>.  This version is the actual software for purchase, but it
adds banners to the transferred messages. Stalker issues license "keys" that
should be entered into the server settings to disable these banners.
<P>
<B>Updates and support</B>
<P>
The updated versions (both betas and finals) are posted on a regular basis.
Update information and free technical support are available via Stalker's very
active mailing list at <A HREF="http://mail.stalker.com/Lists/CGatePro/List.html">http://mail.stalker.com/Lists/CGatePro/List.html</A>.
