The AlphaLinux Kernel HOWTO<br>
Barrett G. Lyon (blyon@doxx.net)<br>
<p>

<B>Why Build a Custom Kernel?</B><br>
The kernel is the heart of Linux and most operating systems.  The kernel is the program that takes on the task of managing
memory, scheduling processes, managing I/O, and all the other miscellaneous low-level tasks that make the system work.  The
Kernel is not a "process," and it does not have a PID, it is not like a process that a user can start.  It pre-exists all
processes and is responsible for starting init (the first process).
<p>
Because it is so important, the kernel has some key privileges.  On Linux, as well as all other UNIX flavors that I am aware 
of, the kernel stays resident in system memory. Other programs can be swapped or paged to disk, but not the kernel.
Therefore, the kernel should be as small and compact as possible, and at one time, it was (back in version 1.x).  But like
most software, the Linux kernel grew with the time: new features and compatibility modes were added, bug-fixes were larger
than the code they replaced, and so on.  If you have been using Linux for a long time, you know the story.  As a result, the
Linux kernel and its tables can require a significant portion of the system's total memory, particularly on small systems.
The goal is to create a custom kernel that is as small as possible: to trim away the fat (unneeded features), and to configure
it to perfectly fit your system and the system's functions. 
<p>
The trick of making a good kernel is to figure out what the system must do, and configure the kernel accordingly.  You may
need to cut out support for some features, while making other features have larger table space, and so on.  
<p>
There is a balance between adding and removing features and table space and it is difficult and time consuming to make it
perfect.  You may want to support more users, allow programs to have more files open at one time, etc.  You may also want to
add new I/O devices or optional features, which require kernel modifications.  As always, performance management involves
making tradeoffs between different aspects of performance; do you want flexibility, speed, or stability?  Is it more important
to support a lot of processes or to have more memory available for just a few processes?
<p><p>


<b>Words of Wisdom</b><br>
As with any serious operation, you should take the proper precautions before you start.  You would not repaint your car unless
you taped up the windows and double-checked everything, unless you like stained-glass.  Therefore, we'll talk about some
precautions before proceeding any farther.  Nothing experienced nothing gained, so please learn form others not-so-wonderful
experiences.
<p>
Before even thinking about rebuilding your kernel, make a spare copy of the current kernel.  Never leave yourself without a
copy of the kernel that works correctly.  You don't care whether or not this kernel is efficient-all you need to know is that
it works.  If your custom kernel has a custom bug, you will have something to fall back on.  When you are dealing with
something this important, paranoia is never inappropriate.  A common convention for managing kernels is to give each kernel a
name of the form of vmlinu*.nn, where nn is 01 for the original kernel and is incremented by 1 for each kernel you build.
Then link vmlinu* to whichever kernel you want to run.  The numbering sequence should match the build number that uname -a
displays.  Only restart the numbering sequence if you go to a new kernel version i.e. v2.2.x to v2.2.y.  Note:  be sure your
bootloader can read a kernel from a link (I think some versions of MILO can't).
<p>
One more caution: On production machines ALWAYS do complete backups before installing a new kernel version.  Why?  Let's just
say that if things go wrong, they can go very wrong.  It is certainly possible for a slightly miss-configured kernel to turn
your nice ext2 file system into a nice random patter of 0's and 1's.  The bottom line is: no matter what you do, make sure you
can get the system back in working order quickly.
<p><p>

<b>Obtaining the current source</b><br>
In the following section we will discuss how to obtain the most current 'stable' version of the Linux source tree.  This is
because Linux development is so active there are always significant new features, together with some new bug fixes.  You
should welcome and install these new releases, even though they require additional work.  However, don't assume that a new
kernel release will run efficiently just because an older one does, particularly if you have the minimum memory configuration
for your system.  For example, during the development process of version 2.2.x, the 2.1.131 release of the development kernel
had serious virtual memory problems that were not present in the previous development release.
<p>
Documenting the configuration process is critical to maintaining a healthy system.  You'll have to go through configuration
again whenever a new 'stable' kernel is released.  When you repeat the process for the new kernel, you will want to know what
you did last time.  After running the new kernel for six months, you may suddenly find out that the assumptions you made when
building it were invalid, or that the system's usage patterns aren't what you thought they were.  You may even have a
long-suffering user/process that has patiently lived with some problem that you introduced.  In these cases, you need to know
what changes you made and what you were thinking about when you made them.  Unlike BSD, you can not add comments to the
configuration files directly, so you will have to keep your own notes.  The main gripe I have about 'make config' or any Linux
configuration utility is that they don't record why you made your changes.
<p>
There are a few different versions of the Linux kernel source.  However the older kernels do not support the granular
configuration options that are included in the 2.2.x kernel sources.  This means that in this section I will only cover
information on the 2.2.x kernels.  
<p>
The first requirement to build a fresh kernel is that you actually have the kernel source itself.  There are a lot of
different places the kernel source can be obtained from a Kernel Archive Mirror System.
<p>
The Linux Kernel Archive Mirror System is set up so that for each two-letter country code from the list below, you can simply
use the host names www.country-abrivation(us,jp etc.).kernel.org or ftp.country-abrivation.kernel.org to reach a mirror
supporting that specific country. Each mirror will have a full archive of /pub/Linux/ and /pub/software/, although they may
not carry both the gzip and bzip2 compression formats.   For a list of these sites please visit
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/mirrors/">www.kernel.org/mirrors/</a>.

<p><p>

<b>Unpacking the source</b><br>
If you installed kernel source when you first installed Linux or installed the kernel source packages, there will already be a
directory or a symlink called `linux' is /usr/src/.  If it is a directory it contains the entire source tree to the Linux
kernel that was previously installed.  If 'linux' is a symlink it points to where the source tree is stored.  If you have the
disk space it is wise to preserve the current source directory.   A good idea is to figure out what version your system runs
now and rename the directory accordingly.  The `uname -r' prints the current kernel version.  If `uname -r' said `2.2.0', you
would rename `linux' to `linux-2.2.0' (I usually call my AlphaLinux kernels axp-x.x.x).
<p>
After you have ensured that the current source tree is saved/backed up in a accessible and safe place, you can then wipe out
the 'linux' symlink or old directory (if it is still there).
<p>
<b><i>*Be sure that there is no `linux' directory in /usr/src/ before unpacking the full source code.</b></i>
<p>
Now, in /usr/src/, unpack the source with `tar zxpvf linux-x.y.z.tar.gz' (if you've just got a .tar file with no .gz at the
end, `tar xpvf linux-x.y.z.tar' works.).  When finished, there will be a new `linux' directory in /usr/src/.  
<p>
A good practice after unpacking any new kernel is to look over the README file located in the new linux direcotry. There will
be a section with the label `INSTALLING the kernel'. Carry out the instructions when appropriate -- symbolic links that should
be in place, removal of stale .o files, etc.
<p><p>


<b>Configuring the kernel.</b><br>
In principle, configuring a new kernel is relatively simple.  A kernel configuration file describes the system you want to
build.  Configuration files are located in the root of where your kernel source is located, this is usually
/usr/src/linux/.config.  
<p>
We will assume that you are starting from a vanilla kernel and that you want to build a new kernel.  
<p>
Because the .config file is an integral part of the entire kernel configuration process removing it would result in needing to
completely re-run the process it takes to build the file, it also holds the history of how your kernel was configured between
different builds.  
<p>
It would make sense to backup the original .config file and name it config.orig.
<p>
A good practice to keep track of the configurations of the kernel, copy the current .config to something like config.X,
replace X with the kernel build number.  Because the source trees between different kernels never overlap you will always have
the configuration files you used to create the kernel images for each build number.
<p>
The command 'make config' while in /usr/src/linux/ starts a configure script which will run you through the kernel
configuration.  The questions that 'make config' asks are our focus of the first step to optimization of the kernel. 
<p>
There are some alternatives to `make config' and you may very well find them easier and more comfortable to use, consort the
README file included in the Linux source.  Below is a list of items I feel are important when trying to build a more efficient
kernel.
<p>

<b>The Goal of the System</b><br>
The system you are building must have some purpose.  This purpose is the focus of your entire kernel configuration, and system
optimization.<br>
Use common sense!  Don't add support to unneeded devices such as Audio devices, or video4Linux to a production server.
<p>
Examples:<br>
Web Servers<br>
Keep in mind that the TCP protocol was originally designed with the assumption that connections are few and long-lived. HTTP,
on the other hand, was designed to be a fast (short-lived), lightweight mean to deliver distributed hypermedia information
requests.  It places little or no load on the CPU or memory resources of a server when compared with other protocols.  On the
other hand, a complete TCP connection is set up and destroyed as part of each HTTP transfer.  For this reason, HTTP has been
labeled as an abuser of TCP.  So while building the kernel add support that will allow you to fine-tune Linux's TCP/IP stack,
advanced router support, remove items that will protect from abuse like SYN Cookies, and add sysctl support so that you can go
and make adjustments to the TCP/IP stack later on.
<p>
Mail Servers<br>
Much like HTTP, this is also deemed as an abuser of TCP, so many of the same items you would configure (and not configure) for
a web server would also apply to a Mail Server.
<p>
Router<br>
A router needs to have as much priority dedicated to the kernel as possible.  When the system's load is high it might be
possible that Linux can't handle all the requests as fast and reduce performance.  Anything that might limit the kernel from
being the main process of the system will be recommended against.  During the configuration process Advanced router support,
and Sysctl will be important in order to make fine tune adjustments to the operation of how Linux will handle routing.
<p>
Shell Servers<br>
A shell server needs stability, so performance is usually second to stability.  A shell box is the MOST abused of these
examples.  Pending on the size of the system the table sizes must be adjusted to support the user load (done later with sysctl
or manual kernel hacking).  In my opinion this is the most fun type of system to configure, mainly because of the huge abuse
the machine will be hit with.  If you build a kernel right, and configure table sizes correct the machine should take a hit
from anything.
<p>
Know Your Hardware<br>
You need to be sure about every device in your system, deeming devices as needed or as unneeded.  If you are building a web
server, do you really need that DVD drive, or a soundcard?  Be sure that you have researched out all your devices.  Also be
sure that the kernel you are building has the most current stable patches applied for these devices.  For example Adaptec SCSI
adapters are a bit unstable unless they have current patch applied, or if your kernel source has the most current driver.
<p>
While configuring the kernel, don't add support to devices you don't have unless you will be adding these devices to the
system soon.  For example: If your entire system uses SCSI disks, then there is NO need to add support for any IDE/RLL type
devices.  If you are unsure, or if you will be adding devices later it might make sense to build them as a module.
<p>
Stability<br>
Occasionally kernel developers will add support to some new-fangled device.  Don't trust new devices unless you have had first
hand knowledge that they do work and are stable.  It is very common to add support for a feature in the kernel just to find
out that it effects something elsewhere.
<p>
The Brag Effect<br>
It is my philosophy that configuring a kernel is all about removing support, not adding support.  Don't add support to a
feature in the kernel unless you absolutely need it, don't add something just to tell your friends that "My box has quiji-bo
support".
<p><p>

<b>Configuration Options</b><br>
Because device and driver options change so frequently I decided it would be counter productive to write a step by step
instruction manual on what devices to add support for and how each device would effect your system.  There is an extremely
detailed list of all the options available during the 'make config' process.  The list covers items that are also not added to
the mainstream kernel.  If you keep in mind everything I listed above and read the list of all the options available, I feel
that you will make a very educated selection.
<p>
You can find the list of options is located at:<br>
<a href="http://math-www.uni-paderborn.de/~axel/config_help.html">http://math-www.uni-paderborn.de/~axel/config_help.html</a><br>
<a href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/config/krnl_cnfg_hlp.x.yz.tgz">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/config/krnl_cnfg_hlp.x.yz.tgz</a><br>
(Replace the x.yz is the version number.)
<p>
You can also locate a lot of information in the linux/documentation directory.
<p><p>
<b>Post 'make config' cleanup</b><br>
After the configure processes has been completed, it is important to take a look at the Makefile located in /usr/src/linux/.
The Makefile contains all the information that will be used to compile the kernel.  It defines what compiler you will be
using, and CFLAGS that will be passed to the compiler during compile time.
<p>
The GCC compiler is the most commonly used GNU C compiler, and is the default compiler the Linux kernel is configured to
compile with.  GCC version 1 was deemed stable about six years ago, and shortly after underwent reexamination.  There were
inherent limitations in its design of GCC 1 that would be difficult to resolve, a major effort was put forth to correct these
limitations that resulted in GCC version 2.  About in 1996 the EGCS project began.  The EGCS project has much the same focus
that the GCC 2 project had, with such goals as reexamination of basic architectural decisions of GCC 2, and the focus of
adding new architectural optimizations. The ongoing efforts of the EGCS project are resulting in a more useful compiler, a
more stable compiler, a central compiler that works for more people, a compiler that generates better code.
<p>
It would make complete sense to use the best compiler to compile the kernel.  As stated before, you want the kernel to be as
small and compact as possible.  Thus making the decision to move off the GCC 2 compiler and to use the EGCS compiler might be
a wise one.  To do this all we need to do is change the definition for the compiler in the Makefile.  Change the compiler from
gcc to egcs, you may also want to find out what CFLAGS you can use to let EGCS know what type of hardware architecture you are
using so it can make the appropriate optimizations.
<p><p>
<b>Compiling the kernel image</b><br>
After you have completely configured your kernel to fit your system, you now have a choice for different types kernel builds.
Linux is used on many different types of architectures and most architectures have different MINILOADERS.  The Alpha mainly
uses the MILO miniloader, and the x86 (Intel based system) uses LILO.  
<p>
Each miniloader loads the kernel differently, uncompressed and with different compression formats.  LILO loads a zImage kernel
image, where MILO loads a gziped kernel (vmlinux.gz).  Because we are buidling an Alpha kernel we will want to build the
gzipped version of the kernel image.  This will be done by using the 'make boot' command. 
<p>
For people who are generally familiar with compiling Linux kernels, here is a quick rundown of commands for the alpha. 
<p><p>
    make mrproper<br>
    make oldconfig<br>
    make config<br>
            <p><p>
During the make config, you will make changes that are appropriate to your particular Alpha system. 
<p><p>

    make dep<br>
    make clean<br>
    make<br>
    make boot<br>
            <p><p>
