	Interesting <A HREF=" http://www.zdnet.com/pcweek/stories/news/0,4153,361622,00.html">  Ziff Davis article </A>
	on the current state of Alpha. It's even mentioned that Compaq has been talking about an EV9 and EV10 chip. The is at
	least the second time I've heard this info so with any luck Alpha has a bright future.

	<P>I've see a preview of the new web page design, looks very good. I think everybody should like it. We even have a new
	mascot, one of Tux's cousins I think. Hopefully we should be changing over in a week or so.

	<P>For people looking to buy a system, I was just sent this link on <A HREF=" http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue31/pavlicek.html"> 
	Linux Gazette</A> for putting together the $500 Alpha System. It's from August but worth a read. You should be able to do it a 
	little cheaper by now.

	<P>I keep getting more info on the 21264. The latest says that it is available now in very limited numbers. Performance 
	looks very good at about 1.5 to 2.2 times the 21164 at similar clock speeds and the 21364(EV7) should be at least a 40%
	improvement over that due to a faster memory subsystem.
	<P>

        Just received some info from <A HREF="http://www.alpha-processor.com">www.alpha-processor.com</A> regarding the long awaited
        21264 chip. The official date is January 1999, and systems should be appearing by February.

        <P>Here's an article on <A HREF=" http://lwn.net/1998/1029/alphaals.html">LWN</A> covering the 
        Atlanta Linux Showcase from an Alpha centric point of view.

	<P>For those of you that think the site is ugly I'm talking with a couple of people who have
        volunteered their services as professional web masters to make the place look a little better.. Stay tuned
        for more info.</P>

        <P>For those looking to compile their own kernel on Alpha I've start a <A HREF="../docs/kernel.html">page</A> 
        devoted to compiling both the stable versions and the development versions.</P>

        <P>As for the 21264 chip, I've received several mails on this. One person said it's available now
         in some systems costing over 200K. Others varied from next month to second quarter 1999. Who knows?</P>

	For those who are looking to compile KDE on Alpha it seems that egcs-1.0.3a and
	binutils-2.9.0.15-1 are a winning combination.

	<P>Well I guess I got what I asked for. Mail has been flooding into my inbox in regards to the site, mostly
	positive I must add. So keep it coming.

	<P>I've added the <A HREF="../intro/">'What is it?'</A> page for people just starting out with AlphaLinux or wondering what it is.

	<P> Just got an email saying that Samsung has released a 700MHz 21164a Alpha chip, still nothing on the release of the
	21264 though, but then again...700MHz, I'll take one of those.

	Well, <a href="http://www.alphalinux.org">www.alphalinux.org</a> is now up and running. It's taken
	a few weeks to get here but we're alive and kicking. As usual we're looking for any info that isn't here already.
	Please feel free to contact <A HREF="mailto:rdp@cheshire.net">me</A> with anything you think belongs here.</A>
	<P>
	We're hoping to provide a comprehensive resource for both newbies and experienced Alpha users, and I'm always
	looking for <A HREF="mailto:rdp@cheshire.net">feedback</A>.

        Here's an article from <A HREF="http://www.crn.com/dailies/weekending102398/oct19dig20.asp">Computer Reseller
        News</A> about Compaq's announcements regarding the Alpha.

        It seems that Compaq has donated an Alpha box to the Debian project. More information can be found
        at  <A HREF="http://lwn.net/daily/debian-alpha.html">Linux Weekly News</A> 

        <FONT SIZE=3><P>I've started breaking out the <A HREF="../hardware/vendors.html">vendors</A> into various categories based on country.
        If you know of others, <A HREF="mailto:rdp@cheshire.net">please send</A> them to me.

        <P>I've also started working on making the images look a little better. I'm slowly starting to understand the Gimp.</P>

        Compaq has decided to offer more support for Linux on both Intel and Alpha platforms. More information is
        available at <A HREF="http://www.linuxresources.com">LinuxResources</A></P></FONT>

        <P>Nils Faerber has started up a project to improve the port of Mozilla for Alpha using Lesstif.. He's setup
        a <A HREF="http://www.unix-ag.org/Linux-Alpha/Mozilla/">web site </A>and some mailing lists for those wishing to help, and 
        for those of you that are interested, here's his <A HREF="mozilla.txt">announcement</A>.
	<P>
        <FONT SIZE=3><A HREF="http://www.cpumicromart.com">CPU Micromart</A> has asked me to pass along the fact that they
        have bought DEC's last stock of UDB/Multias and will be selling them off. They have around 3000 of various types so
        if your looking for a low cost Alpha, check them out. Any specific questions can be routed to 
        <A HREF="mailto:multia@cpumicromart.com">CPU's multia support</A>.

        Good News! The use of the alphalinux.org domain name has been approved. For anybody interested <A HREF="email.txt">here's the
	e-mail</A>. Thanks to everyone involved.

	 There looks to be some info coming out about the 
	 <A HREF="http://www.digital.com/semiconductor/alpha/microprocessorforum.htm">21364 processor</A>. Should be released about
	 the same time as Intel's Merced.</P>

	 <P>In an effort to clean things up all the architecture specific information is now under the <A HREF="../docs">install page</A>.</P>
	 <P>We now have the alphalinux.org domain name registered and we have written to Linux International looking for permission to
	 use the Linux name. Hopefully the move can be made in a couple of weeks. Stay tuned for more info.</P>

	OK, I've got a small list of <A HREF="../hardware/vendors.html">hardware vendors </A>together. A few people have sent
	in information, please keep it coming.

	I'm in the process of setting up a vendor's page. If anybody would like to <A HREF="mailto:rdp@cheshire.net">send me </A>
	the name of the vendor they bought their
	system from and your experiences with the vendor  (good or bad). I'll add your info and try to have it setup this weekend.
	<BR>
	Most people seem to think that alphalinux.org is the best bet for a domain name...more info to come soon.</P></FONT>
