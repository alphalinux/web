	Here's an <A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/pcweek/stories/news/0,4153,1013790,00.html">interesting article from ZDNET</A> in which they talk about Gateway
	using AMD's chip instead of Intel's. The interesting part is about half way down the page where they talk about
	Gateway using the up and coming AMD K7 chip, which as we all know will be socket compatible with the Alpha. So, does
	this mean you'll be able to call up Gateway and order an Alpha machine, with Linux?

            It seems like <a href=http://www.bsdi.com>BSDI</a> is creating a new platform that will run Linux.  It is called 
            <a href="http://www.bsdi.com/press/19981214">Linux Application Platform</a> (LAP).  It will be included with the BSD
            derived releases of the BSD/OS operating system. 
            <br><br>

            <i>"LAP addresses the biggest barrier to widespread industry adoption of Linux applications -- the lack of a
                reliable, commercially supported operating system to run them on. BSDI's LAP also expands the market
                opportunity for Linux application software vendors at thousands of corporations, Internet Service Providers
                and network appliance developers worldwide where BSDI is used".
            </i>

            <br><br>
            BSDI will be releasing LAP during the first quarter 1999.  There is no mention if they will make a BSD like
            release of Linux, but this looks very encouraging with all the current distributions geared to the desktop
            machine.
            <br><br>
            There is no mention of what architecture LAP will run on, but because bsd/os is x86 I would guess x86.  Feel free
to <a href="mailto:info@bsdi.com">email
            BSDI<a/> to find out more.

<b>Linux  v2.2.0 Pre-release Information </b>
<p>
Current Release: <a href="http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.2/">pre7</a>
<p>
I have condensed down the news section on the pre-release kernels to this one news item. 
<p>
There has been chatter on the linux-kernel list about pushing v2.2.0 into current Linux distros.

A few interesting comments about small compatibility issues between the v2.2.0 kernel and a few major distributions caught my
eye: <br><br>
<table>
<tr><td width=100><li><b><small>all</small></b></td><td> dmesg & klogd are not using larger kernel log size in new kernels (8192 bytes vs. 4096 bytes in v2.0).</td></tr>
<tr><td><li><b><small>Debian slink</small></b></td><td> acct package is incorrectly compiled on (with sys/acct.h instead of linux/acct.h, IIRC).</td></tr>
<tr><td><li><b><small>Debian slink</small></b></td><td> procinfo segfaults.</td></tr>
<tr><td><li><b><small>Debian slink</small></b></td><td>lsdev has problems.</td></tr></table>
