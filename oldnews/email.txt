Maurice, Rich et. al.,

While on my travels I was lucky enough to spend a few days with the head
penguin, and we talked about the trademark issues.

Linus has always wanted two things:

	o to make the trademark as easy to use and have as wide a usage as
	  possible

	o to protect it from misuse

Gerry Davis, our lawyer, has advised us that protecting the trademark can be
as easy as allowing usage for all computer and publishing rights (including
organization and web names), but requiring licensing for things like lines of
clothing (note that this does not include people putting "Linux" on their
T-shirts, but having a trademarked line of clothes like "Linuxware").

In one case people wanted to trademark the term "Linux Certified".  Gerry,
Linus and I balked at that, due to the limiting factor it would have on
other certification programs.  But we did wish them to go ahead with their
plans for certification, so I suggested that they put a qualifier (such as
the organization name) in front of the word Linux, to create "XXXXX Linux
Certified".

Finally, in order to save Linus some time, I suggested that (for the time
being) all trademark issues be directed toward me.  I will look at them
and (for the most part) approve them.  Any that I do not approve (for any
reason) or those I have doubts about I will pass past Linus.  And of course
anyone can appeal my logic to Linus without any hard feelings from me.

This is a long, drawn-out explanation to explain why Rich's use of
"alphalinux.org" seems to meet all criteria, so go for it.

Warmest regards,
