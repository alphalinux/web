	People looking to compile 2.2.2 on Alpha can patch the stock 2.2.2 kernel with  Alan Cox's ac4 patch.  
	The patch is available from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/alan/2.2/patch-2.2.2-ac4.bz2">
	ftp.linux.org.uk</A> or locally from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.alphalinux.org/pub/AXP/kernel/patch-2.2.2-ac4.bz2">ftp.alphalinux.org</A>.

	Just received this from our friends at API. If you're going to LinuxWorld Expo make sure to
	stop by their booth and register to win an Alpha system.

	<I><A HREF="http://www.alpha-processor.com">Alpha Processor, Inc</A>. will participate in the upcoming LinuxWorld Expo in
	San Jose, CA scheduled for March 2 through March 4, 1999.  If you plan to
	attend this conference, please come by our booth #1915 and learn more about
	Alpha on Linux.  We are excited to have in our booth representatives from
	DCG; a leading supplier of Alpha workstations and an organization committed
	to supporting the Linux community.
	<P>
	Even more exciting for those visiting our exhibit are we are giving away an
	Alpha workstation.  By completing a game card at our booth, you will

	of <A HREF="mailto:dfrasnel@csee.wvu.edu">Dan Frasnelli</A>. The non-x86 patch takes care of the semaphores

	The good news is that kernel 2.2.2 has been released. The bad news is that it does not compile on Alpha.

		<P>
		It contains new and faster cores. The rc5-core is from Bernie Meyer and the DES-core is from Mr. Dworzak.

	<FONT COLOR="FF0000">***Hot News***</FONT>  A source inside Compaq has revealed to alphalinux.org that Oracle is porting it's Oracle 8 database
	to AlphaLinux., with an expected release data in Q1,1999. So we now have the commitment or a major database
	vendor to AlphaLinux. This source has also told us that several other 1st tier ISV now consider AlphaLinux to
	be a strategic platform.

	RedHat has released updated RPMs for Minicom for all platforms. This fixes a bug in the original version that anybody could
	use Minicom and gain access to the modem. With this update only people specified in the Minicom config file can use the modem.
	The Alpha update is available from <A HREF="ftp://updates.redhat.com/5.2/alpha/minicom-1.82-3.alpha.rpm">ftp://updates.redhat.com</A>.

	Don't forget Compaq is also having announcements today. You can sign up for the live webcast at <A HREF="http://webevents.broadcast.com/compaq/home.html">
	webevents.broadcast.com</A>.
	<P>
	<a href="http://www.news.com">www.news.com</a> has an <a
	href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,31720,00.html?st.ne.fd.gif.f">article</a> about the Compaq's annoucements
	today.
	<p>It seems that Compaq will release two new systems using <a href="http://www.digital.com/alphaoem/papers/microrep/digital2.htm">21264</a> technology. The project once code-named Monet is
	now officially called the <a href="http://www.digital.com/flash/f257/">XP1000</a>.  Along with Compaq, another
	Houston-based parent company is also pushing their new low-end <a href="http://www.digital.com/alphaserver/announce/ds20.html">DS20</a> 
	server (using the same architecture). 
	<P>
	Another interesting tidbit of information is that Digital Unix has been renamed to <a href="
	http://www.unix.digital.com/announcements/">Tru64 Unix</a>.  Compaq obviously wants to absorb Digital's name as much as
	possible.  I'm sure it will be a good product, but I will stick with my 64-bit Penguins.   -Barrett
