	     Kernel 2.1.127 has been released.
	     <P>I've received word that the <A HREF="http://www.azstarnet.com/~axplinux">azstarnet</A> site will no longer be updated. 
	     So I have started moving the various FAQs and HOWTOs over to alphalinux.org. They have yet to be updated but that will take place over the next few                 weeks.

	     <P>The new look to alphalinux.org seems to be nearing completion. Hopefully within a few days things will be converted over.
