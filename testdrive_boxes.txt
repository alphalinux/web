Mike Waite of Compaq Solutions Alliance the other day sent me an updated
list of systems available to 'testdrivers' participating in the free 
CSA Test Drive program (www.testdrive.compaq.com).  Sounds like it
has really taken off; the number of systems available has doubled in 
~1 month, and it sounds like they plan to continue adding boxes. 

If you're thinking about jumping on the AlphaLinux bandwagon, I encourage
you to check out one or all of these systems - you can't beat the price.

Oh yes, I need to note that Compaq is not paying me to say any of this
and this is not an official solicitation from Compaq Solutions Alliance.
