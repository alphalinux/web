The problem lies with the \r\nfact there are few GUI browsers for x86 Linux, let alone our beloved \r\nAlpha. Netscape Communicator makes up the largest GUI browser \r\nuser base. The problem here comes from the 64-bit unclean code that \r\nmakes up what we call Netscape Communicator. By now you are probably \r\nasking if Communicator is not 64-bit clean, how did they make it for \r\nTru64 UNIX? Well I\'ll tell you. They did it with this handy little \r\ncompile time flag part of Compaq\'s compilers called taso. The taso \r\nflag tells the linker to force the code into the lower 31-bit memory \r\naddress space. So what we have here is some questionable code, \r\ncompiled with our good friend taso, that now runs on Tru64 UNIX.\r\n<P>\r\n     Compaq has now released Netscape Communicator 4.7 for Alpha \r\nLinux. The download site may be found at \r\nhttp://www.compaq.com/partners/netscape/downloads/register_nav4_Linux-\r\n.html What you will find there is an RPM package containing both \r\nNetscape Communicator 4.7 and the Tru64 UNIX libraries required to run \r\nit on Alpha Linux. While you do have to register for the download, it \r\nwill cost you no money and only about a minute of your time to fill \r\nout the form. \r\n<P>\r\n     To install Netscape for RPM users simple use rpm with \"-i\" to \r\ninstall. For Debian users you will have to use alien to make a deb out \r\nof it. Alien with \"-dsk\" should produce the required deb, you will \r\nthen need to install it from root (\"/\") as the script is sort of brain \r\ndead. Once you have Netscape installed, you should be able to simple \r\ntype \"netscape\" from an xterm. The very first time you run Netscape \r\nfrom each user account it will give you a few error messages. These \r\nmessages are normal they simply are telling you that the directory \r\n\".netscape\" does not exist and there are no cache directories. Simply \r\nclicking on \"OK\" will let you continue on. Communicator will then \r\ncreate a directory \".netscape\" in your $home and a few configuration \r\nfiles within that directory. \r\n<P>\r\n     The first thing you will probably notice is the awesome speed at \r\nwhich Communicator functions. Compared to the Window$ equivalent it is \r\nquite fast. I would have to say the credit belongs to Compaq\'s \r\ncompiler development team. \r\n<P>\r\n     Java is about the only thing which does not work. Some small Java \r\napplets do run correctly, but others and especially large ones will \r\nlock the browser up. In cases like these you will need to use your \r\ngood friend kill with \"-9\" to take care of it. I highly recommend you \r\ndisable Java all together in edit -> preferences. \r\n<P>\r\n     After using Communicator for a couple of months, I like it. \r\nAlthough I really wish Java worked, but I guess having no Java is \r\nbetter then having no Communicator at all. Something I would like to \r\nyou to take note of is that Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 (potato) has added a \r\nclone of the taso flag. The trick now would be getting \r\nNetscape/AOL/whatever to compile Communicator for us. \r\n<P>\r\nRon Farrer\r\nrbf@farrer.net\r\nFeel free to send me comments, suggestions, corrections. Flames should \r\nbe directed at /dev/null.\r\n\r\n',1,'Articles'),(12,'Netscape on AlphaLinux Part 2\n','2000-09-23 20:00:38','<P>It has been a few weeks since I wrote the first Alpha Linux article. \r\nAfter getting some feedback I decided to do a followup article. First \r\nI would like to make a few corrections! I was informed by a Compaq C++ \r\ndeveloper that the taso flag used in Compaq\'s compilers actually does \r\nforce the code into a 32-bit pointer. Second I have heard from a few \r\npeople who claim that Java does work for them. However when I asked \r\nthem which distro and kernel version they use, none of them answered. \r\nThird I completely forgot to mention that you need a 2.1, 2.2, or 2.4 \r\nseries kernel to run Tru64 UNIX binaries. A 2.0 series will not work.\r\n\r\n<P>I have found a few things I do not like about Netscape. The most \r\nannoying thing is the cache. On my system it gobbled up as much disk \r\nspace as it could. What I found in $home/.netscape/cache/* was about \r\n464MB of cached files! Deleting them quickly gained back all my \r\nmissing disk space. \r\n\r\n<P>Running other Tru64 UNIX programs is also possible with the \r\nNetscape/libs package. The most noteworthy of these is probably Adobe \r\nAcroread. As I\'ve said before, not all Tru64 UNIX programs can be run. \r\nThe usual suspects include programs that use Tru64-style threads. \r\n\r\n<P>Thanks to several people I have gathered a little bit of information \r\non getting Alpha Linux to better support Tru64 UNIX binaries. If \r\nanyone is working on this I\'d like to hear about the progress. I have \r\nalso, again thanks to several people, gathered information on how to \r\nmake our taso flag more like the Tru64 UNIX version. If someone is \r\nworking on that, again, I\'d like to hear about the progress.\r\n\r\n<P>Thanks for your time!\r\n\r\n<P>Ron Farrer\r\n<BR>rbf@farrer.net\r\n',1,'Articles'),(13,'TotalView Debugger','2000-09-23 20:03:21','<CENTER><B>For Immediate Release</B></CENTER>\r\n<P>\r\nFebruary 16th, 2000\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n The TotalView windowing and command line debugger is now available for\r\n  Linux on both x86 (IA32) and Alpha hardware.\r\n<P>\r\n  TotalView is ideal for Beowulf clusters, as it supports \"single point\"\r\n  debugging of distributed, and/or threaded applications in Fortran (77\r\n  and 90), MPI (MPICH) and PVM, as well as C, C++ and machine code.\r\n<P>\r\n  TotalView is the debugger of choice for the DoE ASCI program, where it\r\n  runs on both \"Blue Mountain\" and \"Blue Pacific\" as well as Alpha\r\n  clusters. \r\n<P>\r\n  Full details and downloads of the software and documentation \r\n  from <A HREF=\"http://www.etnus.com\">http://www.etnus.com</A>\r\n\r\n  The site also includes instructions so that you can obtain your FREE\r\n  demo license.\r\n<P>\r\nOn Linux/Alpha we support both the GNU and Compaq compilers.\r\n\r\n',1,'Press'),(14,'Clustered CommuniGate Pro','2000-09-23 20:05:31','<P><B>\r\nStalker Announces Super-Symmetric Dynamic Cluster Version of CommuniGate Pro\r\n\r\n</B>\r\n<P>\r\n<UL>Key Features: \r\n              <LI>Cluster Support - Full Redundancy, Load Balancing</LI>\r\n              <LI>Multi-platform Support </LI>\r\n              <LI>Industry-strength, highly scalable </LI> \r\n              <LI>Administration via the Web</LI>\r\n              <LI>Extensive multi-domain support </LI>\r\n              <LI>Unique IMAP multi-mailbox features</LI> \r\n              <LI> HTTP access to E-mail, built-in Web Mailer</LI> \r\n              <LI> Extensive Anti-Spam techniques </LI>\r\n              <LI> Mailing Lists with Web Access and Interactive Archive Search</LI>\r\n              <LI> LDAP and ACAP Support</LI>\r\n              <LI> Personal Web Pages with automated publishing</LI>\r\n \r\n</UL>\r\n<P>\r\nMILL VALLEY, CA - February 1, 2000 - Stalker Software, Inc. today announced\r\nthe Super-Symmetric Dynamic Cluster version of CommuniGate Pro. The high-end\r\nCommuniGate Pro messaging system is available for Unix, Linux and NT platforms\r\nand can serve 200,000 accounts on single server installations and can now\r\nsupport several million accounts on heterogeneous multi-server Clusters.\r\n<P>\r\nIn 1999 over 4.5 million CommuniGate Pro accounts were licensed to small and\r\nmid-size ISPs migrating to the CommuniGate Pro platform to benefit from its\r\nunmatched stability and performance.\r\n<P>\r\nIn the same period of time, over 1500 CommuniGate Pro servers were installed\r\nat corporate, government, and educational sites that chose CommuniGate Pro for\r\nits standards-compliance and extremely rich feature set.\r\n<P>\r\nThe combined power and performance of CommuniGate Pro is now brought to the\r\ncarrier-grade level with the Dynamic Cluster release.\r\n\r\n<P>\r\nSuper-Symmetric Dynamic Clustering\r\n<P>\r\nCommuniGate Pro is the first product on the market providing true message\r\nclustering based on account-level synchronization. Before the CommuniGate Pro\r\nDynamic Cluster release, large ISPs had to use the solutions that relied\r\ncompletely on OS and FileSystem-level locking. Those solutions were advertised\r\nas scalable and reliable, but suffered from instability and performance drops\r\ninevitable for that type of design.\r\n<P>\r\nWhile Web Interface to E-mail became more and more popular, lock-based\r\nmessaging servers either failed to provide any Web Interface at all or\r\nprovided limited versions of non-native Web Interface at a cost of serious\r\nperformance degradation.\r\n<P>\r\nThe innovative account-level synchronization scheme used in CommuniGate Pro\r\nCluster is based on a TCP/IP protocol and provides non-locking multi-access to\r\nall mailboxes served by the Cluster.\r\n<P>\r\nReleased from file-locking duties, the same storage devices (file servers) can\r\nnow be used to handle much larger number of accounts than they could process\r\nwith older solutions, with increased stability and performance.\r\n<P>\r\nFrontend-Backend Topology\r\n<P>\r\nThe CommuniGate Pro Cluster can include a set of front-end servers taking the\r\nload off the back-end servers by performing all mail relaying operations,\r\nSSL encryption/decryption, and some other operations. Since only front-end\r\nservers are exposed to the Internet, they protect the back-end servers from\r\nall possible types of TCP/IP attacks (including DoS attacks).\r\n<P>\r\nFront-end servers have no access to the account information and protect the\r\nsite from any type of server OS exploits.\r\n<P>\r\nFrontend Load Balancing and Redundancy\r\n<P>\r\nWhile the frontend servers are at a higher risk of failure, the site survives\r\ntill at least one front-end server is in operation. Front-end servers can be\r\nadded and removed from the cluster at any moment, with no switch-off/recovery\r\noperations required.\r\n<P>\r\nThe load can be balanced between frontend servers using traditional traffic-\r\nbased method (as Layer4 Switches) or using DNS round-robin mechanisms.\r\n<P>\r\nBack-end Load Balancing and Redundancy\r\n<P>\r\nSophisticated mail servers can experience heavy load without producing a lot\r\nof traffic (for example, there can be many search operations in progress). To\r\nprovide the best site performance, front-end servers distribute operations\r\nbetween back-end servers based on the real load, not on the traffic volume.\r\n<P>\r\nAll back-end servers provide access to the same domains and accounts, and any\r\nback-end server can be switched off at any time and a back-end server can be\r\nadded to the Cluster at any time, too - without stopping the site.\r\n<P>\r\nThe CommuniGate Pro Dynamic Cluster synchronization protocol provides the\r\nauto-cleanup methods, so if a back-end server fails, there is not need to\r\nmanually clean any resources it could lock at the time of the failure.\r\n<P>\r\nTransparency\r\n<P>\r\nCommuniGate Pro is well known for its clean and clear WebAdmin interface for\r\nboth server and domain (delegated) administration. The CommuniGate Pro Cluster\r\nis completely transparent for both users and administrators, and presents\r\nexactly the same interfaces as it does on single-server sites. Administration\r\ncommands are automatically directed to the proper server and updates are\r\nautomatically propagated to all servers in the Cluster.\r\n<P>\r\n\r\nTry Before You Buy\r\n<P>\r\nThe CommuniGate Pro Free Trial Version is available at\r\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.stalker.com/CommuniGatePro/\">http://www.stalker.com/CommuniGatePro</A>.<BR>\r\nSee <A HREF=\"http://www.stalker.com/CommuniGatePro/Licensing.html\">http://www.stalker.com/CommuniGatePro/Licensing.htm</A> for the details.\r\n<P>\r\nThe updated versions (both betas and finals) are posted on a regular basis.\r\n<P>\r\nDiscuss the Communigate Pro-related issues at\r\n    <A HREF=\"http://mail.stalker.com/Lists/CGatePro.html\">http://mail.stalker.com/Lists/CGatePro.htm</A>.\r\n<P>\r\nThe Dynamic Cluster support requires the Site and Cluster License Keys.\r\nContact Stalker at 800-262-4722 or <A HREF=\"mailto:sales@stalker.com\">sales@stalker.com</A> to learn more about\r\nthe licensing policies.\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n                                         ###\r\nStalker Software, Inc. develops and distributes mail servers, networking and\r\ncommunication software.
