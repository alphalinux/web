Q. When I try to run one of the Iprobe programs, I see
"couldn't open the counter device: Operation not supported by device"
What's going on? 

A. Before using the suite, you must insert the iprobe module.  Use the
following command: 

/sbin/insmod -f iprobe_suite-4.0-driver.o

This will insert the driver into the kernel.

Q. Why I try to insert the driver, I see:

linux_iprobe_driver.o: kernel-module version mismatch
        linux_iprobe_driver.o was compiled for kernel version 2.2.0-pre4
        while this kernel is version 2.1.124.   

A. In order to insert the binary driver into kernels different than the
one that it was compiled for, you must use the -f option when
insmoding it.  The kernel may whine, but the interface will stay the
same, so different versions are not a problem.  

Alternately, you could get the source and recompile it against the
kenrel that you currently have running. 

/sbin/insmod -f iprobe_suite-4.0-driver.o

Q. I am trying to run iprobe against a kernel version < 2.1.132, and I
see something like 
"linux_iprobe_driver.o: get_kernel_syms: Function not implemented"

A. You must have a kernel verion> 2.1.132.  Before this handlers for 
performance counter interrupts could NOT be installed. 

Q. When I try to run iprobe I get "illegal instruction".

A. This is because you are using MILO and the freeware PAL code.  If you
can, try booting through the Digital SRM.  This is a know problem, and
is being worked on by the MILO guru, Jay Estabrook. 

Q. I have questions that you haven't answered, what do I do?

A. First, Read the documenation.  It is either in /doc/ in the
tar file or in /usr/doc/iprobe_suite-X.X if you installed via rpm. 
(The TUTORIAL is a great way to get started. ) 

If that still doesn't answer your questions, send a message to
