What is iprobe?
---------------
Iprobe is the greatest thing since sliced bread. 
                             
In addition, Iprobe is a low-overhead tool suite that uses the Alpha event 
counters to find performance bottlenecks in kernel and userspace. 
                             
The Compaq Alpha processor has some nifty on-chip performance hardware which 
can be used to find bottlenecks in program code. Iprobe gives the user access 
to this hardware.   
                             
The iprobe suite allows one to pinpoint problem code.  It can not only 
determine where a program is spending its cycles, but it can also figure out 
where caches misses and  floating point instructions occur.  A few of the 
questions that Iprobe can help to answer are:  Where is my program missing the
cache?  Where is my program spending allof its cycles?   Which branch path is 
taken most often? 
                            
 Internally, Iprobe has been used to optimize performance in CPU benchmarks, 
on all Alpha operating systems,  and  several  commercial databases. 
                            
 Iprobe has traditionally be a cross-platform Alpha tool. It runs on Digital 
Unix, Open VMS,  and Windows NT, and it is now being released under GPL for 
Alpha/Linux. 

*** Begin SHAMELESS PLUG ****
If you are interested in learning how Iprobe works, and are attending the
1999 ALS, please stop by the Iprobe presentation. 

It will be held on Thursday, Oct 14 at 2:00 pm in Ballroom CD. 

The talk discusses the use of Iprobe to find performance bottlenecks in
Apache.

Who can run it? 
---------------
The iprobe suite should run on all Alpha machines created prior to the EV67. 

Currently, it has been tested successfully on all Alpha/Linux machines that 
boot using the Digital SRM and aboot.  It may NOT run on machines running
MILO. 

For those that use MILO, iprobe MAY work.  For example, 
The AlphaStation 250 is known to work, but not the AlphaStation 500.  

For this, and other performance reasons, SRM is really the way to go.

Iprobe also requires a kernel >2.1.132.  Any 2.2.X kernels should work. 

Where do I get it? 
------------------

http://www.alphalinux.org/~iprobe

The suite consists of two required parts, and a third which is optional:

1) A kernel driver 

iprobe_suite-4.3-driver.o.gz

	This has been compiled for your convenience.  The source is availbe
in the rpm/tarball with the source for the rest of the suite, but it
must be compiled against a kernel with performance counter support, so for 
ease of use,  a binary driver is provided. 

2) Application Suite 

iprobe_suite-4.3-1.alpha.rpm

	These are all the applications that actually use the performance
counters.   Instruction on their use is provided within. 

3) Source 
iprobe_suite-4.3-1.src.rpm

	This is the source for all of the above. 


How do I install?
-----------------
You need both the rpm and the kernel module.  One will NOT work without
the other. 

Get these files: 
iprobe_suite-4.3-driver.o.gz 
iprobe_suite-4.3-1.alpha.rpm

Once you get the rpm, simply type

rpm -i iprobe_suite-4.3-1.alpha.rpm

You will also need to unzip and insert the kernel module.  More information
is available in the INSTALL document. 

*******IMPORTANT************

Documentation will be installed in /usr/doc/iprobe_suite-4.3/  
Read INSTALL for instructions on installing the suite.
Read TUTORIAL for instructions on using the suite.

If you don't read this, it will NOT work, and you will be frustrated.
