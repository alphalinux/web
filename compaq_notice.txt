I would like to correct this point that the license agreement for
distribution from Netscape requires us to track downloads. 

We request that you remove the kit from the public ftp site ASAP.

In a more practical perspective.  The more people we can show who download
the software kit, the greater the credibility that Alpha Linux will receive
in the market.  The more credibility, the greater the investment in
resources by Netscape (and Compaq) in providing more and better tools on the
platform.  We need to show that Alpha is a credible Linux platform vs. x86.


While this is a business and marketing argument, we need to make the case to
be sure that future kits will be available.
