<P>Ok.  This one drove me nuts!  I FINALLY got the box up and running (and 
trust me, I am not a Linux nor Alpha expert!).  I wrote it all down, and 
hope it helps those out there like me who were THIS close to admitting 
defeat.  Remember, it all worked for me, but I can't promise anything. 
Individual results may vary. </P>
 
<P>Update firmware to as200_v6_8.exe.</P>  
<P>Boot ARC console.</P>  
<P>There appear to be several version of this floating around.  I downloaded 
the file referenced here: <A HREF="http://www.windows.digital.com/ntsbuftp/index/epid152.htm">"http://www.windows.digital.com/ntsbuftp/index/epid152.htm</A> </P>
 
<P>It appears to be just the ARC firmware, but I don't really know.  At any 
rate, don't following the instructions inside the README.1ST file in that archive -- 
it's for updating ARC (from ARC).  Use the instructions from step #1 of the first link 
above instead (i.e. <A HREF="http://home.pacbell.net/ryanlath/as200.html">http://home.pacbell.net/ryanlath/as200.html</A>).</P> 
 
<P>Create 3 DOS floppy disks.</P> 
<P>Disk 1: renamed \milo\avanti to just "milo", then copy milo a:copy \milo\arc\linload.exe a: </P>
 
 
<P>This worked fine.  NOTE, HOWEVER, IF YOU HAVE A REDHAT ALPHA CD and have 
added a CD-ROM drive to your system, you can boot it right from ARC.  I 
used 
the following command: 
    boot -t iso9660 scd0:kernels/xl.gz root=/dev/scd0 
 </P>
<P>Note that it uses the "xl" kernel, which seems to work OK for getting into 
the RedHat 
installer (there is no "avanti" kernel, I don't know why).  [ I didn't 
figure this out until 
AFTER I installed everything! ] </P>
 
<P>Disk 2: copy \kernels\xl.gz a:</P> 
 
<P>I'm not sure if I tried this.  Instead, I got the avanti image file from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/linux/redhat/redhat-5.1/alpha/images/avanti.img">
ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/linux/redhat/redhat-5.1/alpha/images/avanti.img</A> 
and used rawrite to put it on the second disk.</P> 
 

<P>Disk 3: rawrite \images\ramdisk.img a: </P>
 
<P>Note, the avanti.gz and avanti-s.gz (SRM) kernels do not seem to work. 
Nor 
did the other 897 milo/ kernel/ ramdisk combos I think I tried... </P>
 
<P>RedHat doesn't even appear to HAVE an avanti.gz image -- strange.  At any 
rate, 
I used the ramdisk image from here:<A HREF="ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/linux/redhat/redhat-5.1/alpha/images/ramdisk.img"> 
ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/linux/redhat/redhat-5.1/alpha/images/ramdisk.img</A> </P>
 
<P>At this point, just do what I say and rename xl.img to vmlinux.img and 
rawrite it onto a floppy.  During the end of the install you will be asked 
for the boot disk - use this one.  I am not sure why, but it worked. </P>
 
<P> 
I just used the disk #2, above.  I don't know why you would need to do this 
extra step. <P>
 
<P>I have a boot choice called "Boot Linux Floppy".  My load options look 
like 
this:</P>
 
<PRE>LOADIDENTIFIER=Linux Floppy 
SYSTEMPARTITION=multi(0)disk(0)fdisk(0) 
OSLOADER=multi(0)disk(0)fdisk(0)\linload.exe 
OSLOADPARTITION=multi(0)disk(0)fdisk(0) 
OSLOADFILENAME=\milo 
OSLOADOPTIONS=nodebug </PRE>
 
 
<P>Boot the box with the Disk 1 in the floppy drive, then choose "Boot Linux 
Floppy" from the boot menu. </P>
 
<P>At the MILO> prompt place the Disk 2 in the floppy and type: 
 
boot fd0:xl.gz "root=/dev/fd0 load_ramdisk=1 prompt_ramdisk=1" </P>
 
 
<P>I used "boot fd0:vmlinux.gz root=/dev/fd0 load_ramdisk=1 prompt_ramdisk=1", 
perhaps because I used the avanti disk image rather than the xl.gz kernel 
mentioned here (or perhaps the filename is inconsequential). </P>
 
<P>When prompted for the ramdisk, place Disk 3 into the floppy.  After it 
gets 
loaded, you *SHOULD* get the Red Hat setup screen. </P>
 
<P>Partition your drive(s), choose your packages, etc.  Install Red Hat. </P>
 
 
<P>You can't use the RedHat partitioner to create your MILO (FAT) partition 
as a primary partition (at least I couldn't figure out how).  I used fdisk 
to 
first create the DOS/FAT/MILO partition (first), then the linux partition 
(again a primary), and then an extended partition with the rest of the 
disk (with swap and other partitions inside it). </P>
 
<P>After the install, I used Disk 1 to boot again, but changed the "Boot 
Linux 
Floppy"<P>
<PRE>OSLOADOPTIONS=nodebug to: 
OSLOADOPTIONS=boot sda6:vmlinux.gz root=/dev/sda6. </PRE>
 
<P>sda6 is mounted on / (root). </P>
 
<P>One BIG caveat.  NONE of this worked with the Number9 video card that was 
shipped with my Alpha from Onsale.  I replaced it with a generic S3 Trio64 
pci video card I had. </P>
 
 
<P>I had much better luck with the #9 card, but I still had problems with it 
once I 
got everything up and running -- it appeared to lock up every once in 
awhile. 
I tried a #9 Motion 771 (a S3/968 based card) and that wouldn't even boot! 
Luckily, I had an STB Nitro 3D (S3/VirgeGX) around as well, and that 
appears 
to work fine (but I had to add the XF86S3V X-server package). </P>
 
<P>If you are wondering, I partitioned my hard drive as follows: </P>
<PRE> 
/home is /dev/sda5 100Mb 
swap is /dev/sda7 48Mb 
/dos 3Mb 
/usr  is /dev/sda1  802Mb 
/  is /dev/sda6  80Mb 
</PRE> 
<P>Now, after logging in as root I used:
 
"dd if=/dev/fd0 of/dev/sda8 bs=1440k"
 
with Disk 1 in the floppy to copy Milo to the DOS partition.  Then you can 
set the load options to boot Linux from the DOS partition.</P>
<P>  My  load options now look like this: </P>
<PRE> 
LOADIDENTIFIER=Linux 
SYSTEMPARTITION=scsi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(5) 
OSLOADER=scsi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(5)\linload.exe 
OSLOADPARTITION=scsi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(5) 
OSLOADFILENAME=\milo 
OSLOADOPTIONS=boot sda6:vmlinux.gz root=/dev/sda6 
</PRE> 
<P> 
For me, with linux installed on sda2, and linload/milo on the first primary 
partition, the lines look like this: 
</P>
<PRE> 
LOADIDENTIFIER=Linux 
SYSTEMPARTITION=scsi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1) 
OSLOADER=scsi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\linload.exe 
OSLOADPARTITION=scsi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1) 
OSLOADFILENAME=\milo 
OSLOADOPTIONS=boot sda2:vmlinux.gz root=/dev/sda2 
</PRE>
<P> 
As others have mentioned, setting SYSTEMPARTITION, OSLOADPARTITION 
and OSLOADFILENAME are not needed (since linload automatically tries 
to load milo from the same directory).  I updated them because I didn't 
want 
to actually verify that the above is true ;-) </P>
<P> 
The critical thing that isn't really mentioned is that the OSLOADER line 
should 
refer to your DOS/FAT/MILO partition.  This is one reason I put it into a 
primary 
partition (although I guess it doesn't really matter).  The OSLOADOPTIONS 
line 
is (obviously) for your actual linux kernel partition. </P>
 
<P>Reboot the machine, choose "Boot Linux" and away you go! </P>
 
 
<P>You probably also want to set up "Autoboot" in the ARC console.  I have two 
Linux boot entries defined, one for linux from the HD (which is the first 
selection, 
which is what gets auto-booted), and another entry for booting MILO from a 
floppy 
(the original load options from above). </P>
 
<PRE> 
Good luck,

PS - Now comes getting XWindows up and running.  Hmmm... 
 
Once I got a working card in there (and ran Xconfigurator) things seem to 
be 
working fine. 
 
Have fun....
