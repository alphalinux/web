    <h1>Installing Debian GNU/Linux on a UDB</h1>

    <p><img align="right" src="udb.gif" alt="picture of a UDB" width="166" height="98">This
    document is a step-by-step guide to doing an installation of the
    Debian GNU/Linux system onto a Digital UDB (aka the Multia).
    There's a lot of documentation floating about, and the aim of this
    document is to provide a central list of pointers for people
    wanting UDB installation information.  There seem to be rather a
    lot of UDBs out there, and a significant fraction are running
    Linux -- maybe there'll be a few more 'cos I wrote this.</p>

    <p>There is more information about the Alpha processor somewhere
    on <a href="http://www.digital.com/"><strike>Digital</strike>
    Compaq</a>'s web site, and useful intros to the UDB <a
    href="http://www.brouhaha.com/~eric/computers/udb.html">here</a>
    and <a href="http://www.annex.co.uk/systems/udb.html">here</a>
    (the latter is currently down).  You'll also want the Service
    Information document (2,216k <a
    href="http://www.brouhaha.com/~eric/computers/udb-man.pdf">PDF</a>,
    4,949k <a
    href="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/BSD/NetBSD/misc/dec-docs/ek-mults-in.ps.gz">PostScript</a>),
    a free &amp; very useful 100-odd page document (also available on
    dead trees from Digital for $85 as part number <a
    href="http://www.digital.com/info/DAHOME/das07qhm.htm">EK-MULTS-IN.C01</a>).</p>

    <p>The prerequisites for following this installation procedure are
    as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A UDB, a monitor and a keyboard (incidentally, don't ever
      use your UDB without a keyboard -- it'll blow the motherboard).

      <li>Two blank floppies for making into boot disks.

      <li>Another networked machine with an NFS mountable directory
      containing the installation <a
      href="http://lhpca.univ-lyon1.fr/axp/bf980705/base2_0.tgz">base</a>
      (7,351k) or, alternatively, half a dozen blank floppies.  CDs
      aren't an option I'm afraid, because no-one's made any yet.
    </ul>

        
    <h2>Make some boot disks</h2>

    <p>Download the following from the <a
    href="http://lhpca.univ-lyon1.fr/axp/debian.html">installation
    disks page</a> (this <a
    href="http://master.debian.org/~lprylli/axp/debian.html">mirror</a>
    is faster for me):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The <a
      href="http://lhpca.univ-lyon1.fr/axp/bf980705/noname/resc1440.bin">rescue</a>
      disk image, which is bootable.

      <li>The <a
      href="http://lhpca.univ-lyon1.fr/axp/bf980705/root1440.bin">root</a>
      disk image, which is loaded into the machine after booting from
      the rescue disk.
    </ul>

    <p>To put the disk images on to floppies, run this command on
    another UNIX box:</p>

    <div class="command">dd if=<span class="changeable">image</span>
    of=/dev/<span class="changeable">fd0</span> obs=18k</div>

    <p>Substitute the <span class="changeable">filenames</span> as
    appropriate -- see the <span class="program">dd(1)</span> man page
    for more details.  If you only have a DOS box handy, you can use
    the <span class="program">RAWRITE.EXE</span> command (download
    either <a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/tools/">rawrite1.zip
    or rawrite2.zip</a>).  See the <!-- 6.2 Creating the boot and root
    floppies --><a
    href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO-6.html#ss6.2">Installation
    HOWTO</a> if you're confused.</p>

    <p>If you're using floppies for the base install rather than NFS,
    download these disk images onto your six floppies as described
    above: <a

    <h2>Decide which console you want to boot from</h2>

    <p>The UDB firmware includes an ARC console, designed for booting
    Windows NT, and an SRM console, which is capable of booting
    Digital UNIX and seems to be more of a diagnostic mode.  They're
    easy to tell apart: the ARC console is white-on-blue, and the SRM
    is white-on-black.</p>

    <p>Once you've got your floppies written, you need to decide which
    console you want to boot from.  I'm not too sure of the pros and
    cons of the two ways of doing this, but I've had success with the
    ARC console, so that's the one I use.  I believe it may be
    possible to reflash the machine so that it will load the Linux
    kernel directly off the disk, but I haven't tried that.</p>

    <h3>How to switch between ARC and SRM console modes</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt>To switch from SRM to ARC:</dt>
      <dd>At the SRM prompt, enter the following command:
        <div align="center"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;arc</code></div>
      </dd>
      <dt>To switch from ARC to SRM</dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>Select the <code>Supplementary menu...</code> menu
          <li>Select the <code>Set up the system...</code>menu
          <li>Select <code>Switch to OpenVMS or OSF console</code>
          <li>Select <code>Switch to Digital UNIX</code>
          <li>Select <code>Setup menu...</code>
          <li>Power-cycle the machine.  You should see the
            <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> SRM console prompt.
        </ul>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>If you've decided to go with the SRM console please <a
    href="#SRM">skip to that section</a>.</p>

    <h2><a name="ARC">Installation using the ARC console</a></h2>

    <p>First of all, you might like to check that you're running a
    recent version of the firmware.  Digital releases <a
    href="ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/readmes/interim/multia/">updates</a>
    from time to time, together with <a
    href="http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/readmes/interim/multia/readme.txt">instructions</a>
    on performing the upgrade.  My machine started off with version
    3.5-7 and is now running 4.33.  Note that your machine may become
    unbootable if it all goes horribly wrong.</p>

    <p>Secondly, reset the boot configuration, as described on page 41
    of the Service Information book (see above for where to get this).
    I had to do this when I replaced the motherboard battery on my
    box, but it won't do any harm to know that we're starting from
    exactly the same position.  I'd set the hardware clock to GMT if I
    were you -- you know where you are with GMT.</p>

    <p>Boot from the boot disk as described in the Debian <a
    href="http://lhpca.univ-lyon1.fr/axp/README">README</a> file,
    section 2b and onwards.  There are a couple of things you might
    like to do as well: when changing the OSLOADFILENAME setting
    change the OSLOADOPTIONS setting to be blank.</p>


    <h2><a name="SRM">Installation using the SRM console</a></h2>

    <p>I haven't explored this option in any depth.  If you want to
    find out more, a good place to start is the <a
    href="http://www.azstarnet.com/~axplinux/srm.html">SRM Firmware
    Howto</a>.</p>

    <h2>Continuing the installation</h2>

    <h3>Disk partitioning</h3>

    <p>Here's how I laid out my partitions (yeah, the disk really is
    that size, it's not my main machine):</p>

    <pre>
/dev/sda1    Boot, NC    Primary   Linux ext2                   281.50
/dev/sda2                Primary   Linux Swap                    46.50
/dev/sda3                Primary   DOS FAT 12                     1.50
    </pre>

    <h3>Installing over the network</h3>

    <p>In order to get an NFS install option you'll need to configure
    the network before installing anything.  You'll have to scroll the
    choice box down in order to see the option -- this briefly had me
    perplexed.</p>

    <p>Configure the server to share the directory with the base file
    in it.  Something like this line in /etc/exports might do the trick:</p>

    <div class="command">/tmp/debian (ro)</div>

    <p>See the <span class="program">exports(5)</span> man page for
    further information -- setting up NFS is a bit outside the scope
    of this document.</p>

    <p>You can try installing from the appropriate menu item now.  If
    you get an error mentioning the nfs module try this short
    workaround:</p>

    <p>Switch to the installation program's shell (using ctrl-alt-F2)
    and mount the NFS export by hand:</p>

    <div class="command">mount -t nfs <span
    class="changeable">192.0.0.1</span>:<span
    class="changeable">/dir</span> /mnt</div>

    <p>Change the <span class="changeable">IP address</span> and <span
    class="changeable">directory</span> as appropriate -- see the
    mount(1) man page for more information.  Watch your typing: the
    delete keys don't work in this shell for some reason.</p>

    <p>Return to the installation program with ctrl-alt-F1 and install
    the operating system `from a mounted disk', giving /mnt as the
    directory.</p>

    <p>I'm not sure whether it was necessary, but I happened to have
    the rescue and root floppy images in the same directory as the
    base file, and the install program seemed to be interested in
    them.  YMMV.</p>

    <h3>Installing from floppies</h3>

    <p>I didn't bother trying this, but I assume that the installation
    program prompts for the floppies in sequence.</p>

    <h2>The base install</h2>

    <p>Install the OS and kernel and the base system.
    <strong>Don't</strong> `make boot floppy', `make linux bootable
    directly from the hard disk' or `configure PCMCIA support' -- I
    gather that none of these work at the moment.  Reboot the system
    with the menu item, which should dump you back into MILO.  You'll
    have 30 seconds to press <kbd>space</kbd> to interrupt the reboot,
    and boot with:</p>

    <div class="command">MILO&gt; boot <span
    class="changeable">sda1</span>:vmlinuz root=/dev/<span
    class="changeable">sda1</span></div>

    <p>Replace with your <span class="changeable">root
    partition</span> as appropriate.</p>

    <h2>The complete install</h2>

    <p>Once your machine comes back up you should be on the same track
    as the bog-standard Intel install, so follow those instructions.
    Choose a root password and start adding packages like crazy (well,
    to tell the truth I couldn't go completely crazy, given those
    200-odd rather cramped megs...).  The <a
    href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/main/disks-i386/current/dselect.beginner.html">dselect
    tutorial</a> is tedious but obligatory reading at this point.</p>

    <p>By the way, a nice fast UK mirror of the Debian distribution
    can be found at <a
    href="ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/Mirrors/ftp.debian.org/">Sunsite
    Northern Europe</a>.</p>

    <h2>Making your hard disk bootable (ARC)</h2>

    <p>At this stage you've hopefully got a fully working installation
    on your computer, with one exception: it won't be able to boot off
    the hard disk.  To fix this you need to install <span
    class="program">MILO</span> and tell the ARC console where to find
    it.  Download <a
    href="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/Digital/Linux-Alpha/Miniloader/latest-Images/UDB/milo">
    <span class="program">MILO</span></a> and <a
    href="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/Digital/Linux-Alpha/Miniloader/arc/linload.exe"><span
    class="program">linload.exe</span></a> from Digital's ftp site
    (see the <a
    href="http://www.azstarnet.com/~axplinux/milo.html">Alpha
    MIniloader HOWTO</a> for locations).  Hopefully you've left a
    small FAT partition on your disk -- mount this and copy <span
    class="program">linload.exe</span> and <span
    class="program">MILO</span> into it:</p>

    <div class="command">mount -t msdos /dev/sda3 /mnt</div>
    <div class="command">cp /tmp/milo /tmp/linload.exe /mnt</div>
    <div class="command">umount /mnt</div>

    <p>You now need to reboot and set up ARC to bootstrap first <span
    class="program">linload.exe</span> then <span
    class="program">MILO</span>, and finally the kernel.  It's not as
    bad as it sounds, honest.  Power-cycle the machine and follow the
    steps below in the ARC menu system:<p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Setting up ARC to boot via linload.exe and MILO
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>Select the <code>Supplementary menu...</code>
          <li><code>Set up the system...</code>
          <li><code>Manage boot selection menu...</code>
          <li><code>Add a boot selection...</code>
          <li><code>New system partition</code>
        </ul>
      </dd>
    </dl>


   <p>You'll now be given several options and asked to complete a few
   fields.  The screen should look something like this by the time
   you've finished:</p>

<pre>
      Select media:
    SCSI Hard Disk

    Enter SCSI bus number: 0
    Enter SCSI ID: 0
    Enter partition (must be FAT or NTFS):  3

Enter the osloader directory and name: linload.exe

Is the operating system in the same partition as the osloader:
   Yes

Enter the operating system root directory:

Enter a name for this boot selection: Debian GNU/Linux

Do you want to initialize the debugger at boot time:
   No
</pre>

    <p>Continue through the menu system as detailed below:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li><code>Change a boot selection...</code>
          <li><code>Selection to edit:</code> -- choose the selection
          you've just made, ie `Debian GNU/Linux'.

          <li>Change <code>OSLOADOPTIONS</code> to be a <span
          class="program">MILO</span> boot command, the same as the
          one you used earlier:

            <div class="command">boot sda1:vmlinuz root=/dev/sda1</div>

          <li><code>Setup menu...</code>
          <li><code>Supplementary menu, and save changes...</code>
          <li><code>Boot menu...</code>
          <li>The <code>Boot Debian GNU/Linux</code> menu item will
          hopefully boot your system off the hard disk.
          Congratulations, you're finished.
          <li>You might want to delete the boot selection which boots
          from the floppy.
        </ul>
      </dd>
    </dl>


    <h2>Kernel/X config and UDB hardware</h2>

    <p>When you build your first kernel you'll need the following
    information: the network card in the UDB is a 21040 Tulip.  The
    sound card is a Microsoft Sound System compatible, which needs to
    be set up on IRQ 9, IOBASE 530 and DMA 3 (choose only /dev/dsp and
    /dev/audio support).  The on-board video is a 21030 TGA, so use
    the TGA X server.  The SCSI controller is an NCR 53c810.  As
    previously mentioned, PCMCIA doesn't work at the moment.  To use
    both serial ports you'll need to buy or build a y-shaped cable,
    because they share a socket.  That should be enough for you to be
    getting on with for the moment.</p>
