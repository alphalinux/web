<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Profiling Repair.</A></H2>

<P>To make profiling work, you need two patches from David Mosberger
which were posted to axp-list@redhat.com (tracked down by Toon Moene
who posted their archive URLs to axp-list).  You might also need one
of the gcc patches mentioned above.</P>
<P>In any case, David Mosberger's patches are in the axp-list archive at:</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/support/mailing-lists/archives/axp-list/1997-March/0463.html">http://www.redhat.com/support/mailing-lists/archives/axp-list/1997-March/0463.html</A></P>
<P>and</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/support/mailing-lists/archives/axp-list/1997-March/0464.html">http://www.redhat.com/support/mailing-lists/archives/axp-list/1997-March/0464.html</A></P>
<P>The former is a source patch for binutils to keep gprof from seg
faulting, and the latter is a binary patch for libc_p.a to keep your
programs from seg faulting.</P>
<P>For convenience, both are included in the Patches section.  The former
is in binutils-new-patches.tar.gz.uue, along with an RPM spec file for
incorporating it into binutils-2.7.0.2-4.src.rpm, and the latter is
David Mosberger's libc_p.a binary patch.</P>
<P>To fix gprof, unpack binutils-new-patches.tar.gz.uue, and rebuild
binutils-2.7.0.2-4.src.rpm analogously to the instructions above for
gcc.  But, *don't* install the binary rpm after rebuilding.  It
conflicts with the libc headers.  Just either copy gprof over the
version in /usr/bin, or override the /usr/bin version with the new one
in /usr/local/bin, etc.</P>
<P>As for the binary patches for libc_p.a, here's an extract from David
Mosberger's message about it how to apply them:</P>
<P>After extracting these files, replace them in your libc_p.a. E.g.:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
   ar rv /usr/lib/libc_p.a gmon.po ieee_{s,g}et_fp_control.po
</PRE>
</P>
<P>and then profiling should work again. Note that the binutils-2.7
gprof has a bug that sometimes causes a SIGFPE. See my earlier mail
for a patch that fixes this.</P>
<P>Finally, there is still a problem with mixing profiling and dynamic
linking. E.g., with dynamic linking, adding -lm will cause a binary
that segfaults. Adding the -static flag should fix this problem for
now (until a real solution is found).</P>
