<P>This document details what parts of the Redhat alpha 4.2 distribution
need repair, and why.  It covers patches needed for the kernel, gcc,
and to make profiling work.  I don't know how much of this applies to
Redhat 5.x - probably not much.  Thus, this is mostly useful for those
who for one reason or another choose not to upgrade to 5.x.</P>
<P>Someone in the know please check this for ACCURACY!!!</P>
<P>Thanks to 
<A HREF="Dominique.Quatravaux@ens.fr">Dominique Quatravaux</A> for
his excellent 
<A HREF="http://www.eleves.ens.fr:8080/home/quatrava/AXP-port-FAQ/index.html.en">AXP/Linux port FAQ</A>.
It explains many of these issues in detail.  You should read that
too.  It's always better to have two sources...</P>
<P>Thanks to 
<A HREF="mailto:rth@dot.cygnus.com">Richard Henderson</A> for explaining many of the
additional points on which I was confused.</P>
