	      The DP264 series includes the DS20 (DP264 OEM version), DS20E, ES40, DS10, XP1000, XP900 and UP2000 based systems. When
	      compiling a kernel all of the machine require either a generic of DP264 specific kernel.

	      <P>
	SRM should be used to boot the DP264 series. There is a MILO for these machines however it is not very reliable.

<P>
	The Goldrush (DS20 and DP264) systems are a EV6 or EV67 (21264, 21264a) based system with 1 or 2 CPUs on
	daughter cards, 2 PCI buses and support up to 4Gig of RAM. 
	The DS20 is officially supported from Compaq as a Linux box. Kernels 2.2.1 and later have support and can be
	compiled as DP264 or generic.<P>
	The GoldRack (DS20E) is either a workstation or rack mount version of the DS20.

             <P>The Swordfish is the first motherboard to come out of <A HREF="http://www.alpha-processor.com">Alpha Processor Inc.</A>
	     in Concord Mass. The UP2000 is a uni or dual processor motherboard based around the Tsunami chipset though four
	     of the C Chips have been removed so it only has one 256bit memory bus instead of two. This is also
	     the first motherboard to use API's Slot B processor cartridge. Current configurations range from a 667MHz 2MB version
	     up to a 750MHz 8MB version.<P> This motherboard was used to demonstrate the worlds first 1GHz chip running at room
	     temperature at PCExpo in June 1999.

           The Monet/Brisbane is the last of the purpose built Alpha workstations to come out of Digital/Compaq. From now on all
	   workstation will be derived from server products. The systems have a 4MB cache and support up to 2Gig of memory.

	   <P>The Monet is a single 500MHz workstation, Brisbane is the 667MHz version.

           The DS10 (webbrick) is based on a 466MHz EV6 with 2MB cache. The processor is soldered to the
	   board (unlike the DS20 daughter cards) and it not upgradeable. They also make use of the ALI
	   IDE controller instead of the Cypress present in the DS20 series. Also available is the
	   DS10L (slate) which is a 1U rackmount version, both of these are now available with a 600MHz CPU.

        The clipper is the high end of the Tsunami series. It supports up to 4 500MHz processors
	with up to 16Gig of memory.

<P>	<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Note:</B></FONT> The kernel with RedHat 5.2 for the DP264 is broken in
	respect to cards with builtin PCI-PCI bridges (Ex:  IntraServer cards that have 2 SCSI plus Ethernet
		behind a bridge). If you are using one of these cards then use one of the images below.

<P>	   <FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Hints and Tips for the DS20/DP264:</B></FONT><P>
           1) Large memory configurations<P>

At the time of writing, the maximum memory capacity of any Alpha machine running Linux is 2GB. Putting any more memory than this into your DP264 will result
in a spectacular boot-time crash<P>

2) The SRM console must have the variable os_type=vms when using the system with larger memory configurations. The OSF (Digital Unix) PALcode would cause
problems which are cured by booting from the VMS PALcode. The correct PALcode is then installed by aboot.<P>

3) SCSI cards, video cards and PCI buses.<P>

Video cards must be put onto PCI bus 0.<P>

In early revisions of the DP264, the system would not work with an Adaptec 2940UW SCSI card on PCI bus 0. In general, there is a performance hit when any
SCSI card is put onto the same PCI bus as the video card. Put your SCSI card onto bus 1.<P>

4) Non-generic kernel builds<P>

Kernels up to and including 2.2.9 can not be built as anything other than generic kernels, due to a bug in the initialization procedure. Don't build them
specifically for the DP264.   <P>
