	      What is AlphaLinux?
              </B></FONT><BR> 

	      AlphaLinux is a port of the Linux operating system to Compaq (was Digital)'s Alpha CPU.
	      The Alpha is a true 64-bit CPU that holds the title as the fastest chip currently available, with speeds
	      up to 833MHz. Most of the other components in an Alpha system are the same as an Intel based PC, and most
	      of the x86 Linux software available today can be recompiled on the Alpha.


	      <P>

	      <FONT SIZE="+1"><B>
	      Where can I get an Alpha system?
              </B></FONT><BR> 
	      We currently have a list of <A HREF="../hardware/vendors.shtml">vendors</A>, both in the U.S. and internationally that sell Alpha hardware
	   

	      <P>

	      <FONT SIZE="+1"><B>
	      How do I get AlphaLinux?
              </B></FONT><BR> 
	      You can buy a distribution from one of the vendors. Currently <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com">RedHat</A>, <A HREF="http://www.debian.org">
	      Debian</A>, <A HREF="http://www.suse.com">SuSE</A>,  <A HREF="http://www.rocklinux.com">RockLinux</A> and <A HREF="http://www.linux-mandrake.com">Mandrake</A> have AlphaLinux distributions. Just like its x86 counterpart all of this
	      software is available for download from the Internet. Though it's always a good idea to buy a distribution to help fund continued development.
	     
	      <P>
	      <FONT SIZE="+1"><B>
	      Are they more difficult to setup than x86 machines?
	      </B></FONT><BR>
	      The Alphas do tend to be a little more difficult to setup than x86 machines. They have much more complicated  firmware than
	      x86 machines and were designed to run Digital Unix (OSF/1), VMS and of course Windows NT. However, don't let this discourage you. There are
	      lots of these machines around and the support from the AlphaLinux community is excellent.
	    
	      <P>
	      <FONT SIZE="+1"><B>
	      How much do they cost?
	      </B></FONT><BR>
	      New Alphas are usually a little more expensive then x86 machines. However there is a plentiful supply of
	      older and used machines out there. I picked up my Multia (a 166MHz version) for only fifty U.S. dollars. Not bad....
	      
	      <P>
	      <FONT SIZE="+1"><B>
	      Where do I get help?
	      </B></FONT><BR>
	      There are several places to turn. One is the<A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.alpha"> comp.os.linux.alpha</A> newsgroup. Both Debian and
	      RedHat have email lists, you can find more about those on our <A HREF="../otherpages/index.shtml">otherpages</A> section.  Also we
		have <A HREF="../archives/">archives</A> of the major Alpha mailing lists.
	      <P>
	      <FONT SIZE="+1"><B>
	      Which system should I buy?
	      </B></FONT><BR>
	      Most of the systems are well supported at this point. However do not buy any of the TURBO channel based
	      DEC 3000 series as these are not supported.
	      
	      <P>
	      <FONT SIZE="+1"><B>
	      What's performance like?
	      </B></FONT><BR>
	      Well my Multia (a 166MHz) pretty much keeps pace with my Pentium 100. Obviously the newer machines are much faster. Things
	      are getting better as the compilers become more mature. If you're looking to get the highest performance from your Alpha
	      then it's worth checking out our <A HREF="../docs/high_perf.shtml">High Performance Page</A>.
