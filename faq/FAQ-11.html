<H2><A NAME="ss11.2">11.2 Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P> The Ruffian board is broadly similar to the 164LX board, but beefed up with
six DIMM slots instead of four (giving a maximum memory capacity of 1536MB),
and with on-board SCSI and ethernet.  It also takes higher-clocked EV56 
processors (up to 667MHz) and has more PCI slots.
<P>
<H3>Hardware configuration:</H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> Intel PIIX3 Southbridge and IDE controller.
</LI>
<LI> Symbios 53C875 SCSI controller.
</LI>
<LI> DEC 21143 Tulip ethernet controller.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P> In all, a well-configured EV56 workstation.
Yet it is plagued with a bad reputation.
<P>
<P>
<H3>The Caveat</H3>

<P> While the vast majority have no trouble with their Ruffians (author
included), a handful of users find fundamental shortcomings that make the 
board unusable for their applications. 
<P>
<H3>The Symptoms</H3>

<P> A virtual memory stress-test that induces continuous heavy paging can 
cause the machine to die.  The problem manifests itself through various 
"Unable to handle kernel paging request", "killing the swapper", 
"attempting to swap the idle process" messages, and a register dump. 
The system may become unusable after that. 
<P>
<P> The stress-test may run without failure (I have run it for three days 
without fault), or it may fail within seconds.
<P>
<P> Some people claim this problem only arises with large memory configurations. 
<P>
<H3>The Fix</H3>

<P> 
<A HREF="mailto:dobrek@itp.uni-hannover.de">Lukasz Dobrek</A> 
of Hannover University has identified that his processor has been
overheating and believes that this has been causing the problems described
above.  He put some silicon paste between processor and heatsink and
found that his machine became stable again.  Silicon paste is an interface
material that improves heat transfer between surfaces.
<P>
<P> Other people have suggested that the problem is aggravated in large memory
configurations.
<P>
<P> Elsewhere it has been suggested that using the latest milo will help 
improve stability.

<H2><A NAME="ss11.3">11.3 Hardware Issues with the Ruffian </A>
</H2>

<H3>Ruffian On-board Ethernet </H3>

<P>The Ruffian's on-board DEC Tulip Ethernet is not very good at
auto-sensing a 100Mbit link with the Linux Tulip driver.  Using recent 
versions of the tulip driver appears to help.  The author has also found 
the problem to be sensitive to the network hardware.  By changing hubs, or 
even ports on the same hub, the problem disappears.
<P>
<P>The tulip device driver page is well documented at:
<UL>
<LI> 
<A HREF="http://www.scyld.com/network/tulip.html">http://www.scyld.com/network/tulip.html</A></LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>These pages also contain instructions on how to install the
driver. Alternatively, try looking at the section on building your own
kernel in this FAQ. (The location of the tulip device driver in the
linux source tree is drivers/net/tulip.c, copy your newly-downloaded
version in here and you're ready to build)
<P>
<P>If your ethernet doesn't autosense 100Mbit, there are some other
options I have found to sometimes work, although we're in experimental
territory here and what may work for me may not work for you.
<P>
<P>Your first option is to hard-code your ethernet interface to be 100baseTX, 
bypassing the autosensing mechanism. However, this doesn't always work. What 
does sometimes work is hard-coding the medium to be 10Mbit, and then 100Mbit. 
The first packet will fail transmission, but after that the link is brought up 
in 100Mbit mode. To bypass the auto-sensing mechanism, edit tulip.c and put 
numbers into the options array, according to your media type as defined in 
an array further down the code (10baseT is 12, 100baseT is 4). If you still 
can't get this to work, try this patched version of the tulip driver, actually 
patched for the Miata by Loic Prylli. What it does is to keep trying with 
user-specified hard-coded media.
<P>
<P>Again, your experience may vary...
<P>
<H3>Video Cards </H3>

<P> Older versions of MILO (the bootloader) required that the video card was 
put into the 64-bit slot.  This was because all the other PCI slots are behind
a PCI-PCI bridge which was not correctly supported by MILO.
<P>
<P> However, work by Nikita Schmidt and Stefan Reinauer have addressed this 
problem and recent MILOs support a video card in any PCI slot, freeing that 
64-bit slot up for better things...
<P>
<P> You can find Nikita's work 
<A HREF="ftp://genie.ucd.ie/pub/alpha/milo/">here</A> 
and Stefan's work 
<A HREF="http://www.suse.de/~stepan/">here</A>.
Stefan's work builds upon the improvements done by Nikita on the stock MILO
available from Compaq at the Gatekeeper FTP site above.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="ss11.4">11.4 The Red Hat Release CDs and the Ruffian </A>
</H2>

<P> Unfortunately, both Red Hat 5.1 and 5.2 releases have flaws to be aware 
of when installing on a Ruffian.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.5">11.5 Red Hat 5.1 </A>
</H2>

<P>For your first disk, you should use a different milo and ldmilo.exe
file, which are downloadable from Gatekeeper, Digital's FTP server:

</UL>
<P>
<H3>How to build your milo disk</H3>

<P>
<OL>
<LI>   Take a DOS-formatted floppy </LI>
<LI>   Copy the two files above onto it, renaming them to 'ldmilo.exe' and 'milo' </LI>
<LI>   Thats it, you're done :-) </LI>
</OL>
<P>
<H3>Running XFree with Red Hat 5.1 </H3>

<P>If the XFree X server fails to start on your system, try adding the
following link:
<P>
<P><CODE>cd /etc; ln -s EB164 alpha_systype</CODE>
<P>
<P>If your graphics card uses the SVGA X-server (eg, if you have a
Matrox graphics card), you should also pick up the patched SVGA server. (
<A HREF="ftp://mea.tmt.tele.fi/pub/XFree86/">ftp://mea.tmt.tele.fi/pub/XFree86/</A> ).  Or, upgrade to a newer 
version of XFree, as packaged with any current distribution.
<P>
<H3>Reading the time and date correctly with Red Hat 5.1 </H3>

<P>The Ruffian ARCSBIOS uses a different format for time and date. In
releases of Red Hat up to 5.1, this meant that Linux would not report
the correct date and time.
<P>
<P>This can be fixed using: 
<UL>
<LI>     An updated version of the clock binary (try gatekeeper), </LI>
<LI>     by getting your date and time from another system on the network using rdate -s, </LI>
<LI>     or by using xntpd. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>Date and time issues are fixed for the Ruffian in Red Hat 5.2 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.6">11.6 Red Hat 5.2 </A>
</H2>

<P>Unfortunately the Ruffian kernel provided on the Red Hat 5.2 CD
doesn't contain support for the Symbios 875 on-board SCSI. However,
you can take the kernel image from Red Hat 5.1 to perform the
install. Once installed, you can build your own kernel - the sources
on 
<A HREF="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/Kernels">ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/Kernels</A>
for 2.0.35 are tried and trusted.
