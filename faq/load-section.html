>5.1. Loading MILO from the Windows NT ARC firmware</A
></H2
><P
>Most, if not all, Alpha AXP based systems include the Windows NT
ARC firmware and this is the prefered method of booting MILO and thus
Linux.  Once the Windows NT firmware is running and you have the correct
MILO image for your system, this method is completely generic.</P
><P
>The Windows NT ARC firmware is an environment in which programs can run
and make callbacks into the firmware to perform actions.  The Windows NT
OSLoader is a program that does exactly this.   Linload.exe is a 
much simpler program which does just enough to load and execute MILO.
It loads the appropriate image
file into memory at 0x00000000 and then makes a swap-PAL PALcall to
it.  
MILO, like Linux, uses a different PALcode to Windows NT which is why the
swap has to happen.
MILO relocates itself to 0x200000 and continues on through the
PALcode reset entry point as before.</P
><P
>Before you add a Linux boot option, 
you will need to copy linload.exe and the appropriate MILO that you
wish to load to someplace that the Windows NT ARC firmware can read from.  
In the following example, I assume that you are booting from a DOS format floppy
disk:</P

The two jumper bank is J1 and is located at the bottom

You select between the boot options (and MILO when it is
been put into flash) using a combination of jumpers and a boot option which
is saved in the NVRAM of the TOY clock.</P
