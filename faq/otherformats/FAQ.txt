  Linux/Alpha is for real: pretty much everything is up and running:
  there is XFree86, LaTeX, ghostview, Netscape, Emacs, gcc, C++, NFS,
  automounter, all sorts of shells, perl, python, Java, Tcl/Tk, scheme,
  apache HTTP server, and pretty much anything else that's freely
  available.  X11 works well on several video cards (see below).  Thanks
  to Dave Taylor and Linus Torvalds, there is now even a Quake binary
  <ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/X11> for Linux/Alpha!
  Since April 1997, it is now also possible to run many Linux/x86
  binaries through the em86 emulator. (See section ``'') The list of
  applications supported by em86 includes gems such as applix, Netscape,
  and acrobat.  The emulator has been made available free of charge by
  Jim Paradis of Digital Semiconductor.

  Linux/Alpha presently runs on most of the Alpha boxes that come with
  the PCI or EISA bus.  This excludes the old TURBOchannel based DEC
  3000 series of workstations.



  11..11..  SSuuppppoorrtteedd DDrriivveerrss

  DDrriivveerrss tthhaatt aarree kknnoowwnn ttoo wwoorrkk (let us known if there is something
  new):

  +o  X11:  Almost all XFree86 drivers work on Linux/Alpha.  Perhaps the
     biggest missing feature is packed 24-bit support.  32bpp/depth 24
     works fine, though.
     The SVGA server on Alpha supports only a subset of the cards
     supported on Intel: Matrox and S3Virge are supported, but a number
     of older chipsets are not.
     SuSE is actively involved with the development of XFree. If you
     have a card that isn't supported yet, you may find a driver at
     their website <http://www.suse.com/>.

     There are some development X servers available from Digital's FTP
     site <ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/X11>; you might
     check there if XFree86 doesn't work on your system.

     Commercial X-servers are available from MetroLink and XiGraphics.
     (See the section on commercial software.) You may need these if you
     have a very new graphics card.

  +o  keyboard

  +o  console (TGA, EGA+ or VGA+ compatible cards)

  +o  selection (console mouse support)

  +o  serial

  +o  line-printer (centronics port)

  +o  floppy

  +o  SCSI: disks, CD-ROMs, and tapes seem to work fine.  Host adapters
     that are known to work:

  +o  NCR/Symbios 53c810, 825, 875 (use the ncr53c8xx driver),895,896

  +o  aha1740 (on Jensen, at least)

  +o  BusLogic (all cards ISA or PCI cards should work fine except for
     the Flashpoint; EISA cards may be flaky in older EISA systems).

  +o  Qlogic ISP1020

  +o  support for Adaptec cards in now fairly solid though users do
     occasionally have problems with them.


  +o  ftape (QIC-80 tape drives)

  +o  IDE driver: disks and CD-ROMs (ATAPI) are known to work.

  +o  Networking:

  +o  Ethernet drivers: de4x5, de500, depca, ewrk3, ne2000.  The
     following drivers are supposed to be working as well:

  +o  Western Digital (aka SMC Elite) wd80x3

  +o  SMC Ultra

  +o  SMC EtherEZ

  +o  3Com 3c503, 3c503/16, 3c509-B, 3c509-C

  +o  Cabletron e2100

  +o  Hewlett Packard PC Lan  (model 27245, uses hp.c)

  +o  Hewlett Packard PC Lan+ (model 27247 or 27252A, uses hp-plus.c)

  +o  Ansel AC3200 EISA card.

  +o  AMD PCnetPCI (79C970 and 79C970A) based Ethernet cards (LANCE32
     driver).

  +o  Intel EtherExpress Pro/100

  +o  Other drivers: ppp, ibmtr (IBM token ring driver).

  +o  ISDN: ICN 2B and ICN 4B cards (if you have problems with them,
     contact Thomas        Bogendoerfer
     <mailto:tsbogend@bigbug.franken.de>).


  +o  Cameras/Scanners: QuickCam (both grayscale and color versions).  HP
     ScanJet reportedly work.  Mustek flat scanners are supported, too.

  +o  Sound cards: SoundBlaster compatible cards seem to work well.  The
     Microsoft Sound System compatible card built into the UDB is
     supported, too.

  +o  Joystick: The joystick interface on a SoundBlaster16 (which is just
     a regular PC joystick port) is known to work with joystick-0.7.3
     (as a module).  There were a few minor patches that had to be
     applied.  If you want it, send mail to David Mosberger
     <mailto:David.Mosberger@acm.org>.  The "koules" game is known to
     work with the joystick.

  This section lists known bugs in Linux/Alpha and discusses how they
  can be avoided or worked around.  As things are under constant
  development, this section is rather volatile.  Just because it isn't
  listed here doesn't mean the problem isn't known already.  On the
  other hand, if you run a recent distribution, it's likely that most of
  the problems have been addressed already.  In any case, before sending
  mail off to axp-list <mailto:axp-list@redhat.com>, be sure to check
  this section first.  If you discover a new problem/workaround, we
  would appreciate if you could send us a report (preferably in linuxdoc
  SGML format).

        The Linux kernel currently has /dev/sda2 hard coded as its
        default root file system.  Thus, if your root file system is on
        any other disk or partition, you will have to specify the boot
        option root=/dev/_r_o_o_t_-_p_a_r_t_i_t_i_o_n.  For example, if the root file
        system is on /dev/hda1, you'd specify root=/dev/hda1.


     EELLFF gdb behaves odd w.r.t. shared functions.
        When using gdb on a dynamically linked binary, it is best to
        force eager resolution of dynamic symbols.  To do this, simply
        issue the command set env LD_BIND_NOW=1 from within gdb.
        Otherwise, you may see unexpected behavior when trying to step
        into or over a shared function.  The source of this problem is
        known, but nobody has had time yet to fix the problem.


     KKeerrnneell rreeppoorrttss 22..8888MMBB ffllooppppyy ddrriivvee::
        On the Alphas, the kernel _a_l_w_a_y_s reports floppy drives as having
        2.88MB capacity even if a smaller capacity drive is installed.
        This is nothing to worry about: normally, the floppy driver
        automatically detects and selects the correct capacity so
        everything will work fine.  The only exception to this rule is
        when formatting a new floppy disk.  To do this, you'll need to
        select the device name with the correct capacity.  For example,
        if the system has a 1.4MB drive, format /dev/fd0H1440 instead of
        /dev/fd0.


     UUnnaalliiggnneedd aacccceesssseess::
        The Alpha, like all real RISC CPUs, requires that memory
        accesses are _n_a_t_u_r_a_l_l_y _a_l_i_g_n_e_d.  For example, reading a 4 byte
        integer from memory requires that the address of the integer be
        a multiple of 4.  Similarly, 8 byte integers need to start at an
        address that is a multiple of 8.  If the CPU attempts to access
        a word that is not properly aligned, the CPU will trap into the
        kernel and issue a warning message.  The kernel will then go
        ahead and emulate the unaligned access so that the user-level
        process executes as if nothing had happened (except for a
        substantial slow-down due to the fault).

        Typically, an unaligned fault message looks like this:


          X(26738): unaligned trap at 000000012004b6f0: 00000001401b20ca 28 1





     What this means is that the process executing command X (the X11
     server) with process id 26738 caused an unaligned fault accessing
     address 0x1401b20ca.  This access was performed by the instruction
     located at address 0x12004b6f0.  The other numbers are less impor-
     tant, but if you check the kernel sources, you'll find that they
     tell you more info on what kind of instruction caused the fault
     (e.g., a load vs. a store).

     You do not need to be overly alarmed when seeing such a message.
     The program causing the faults will work _c_o_r_r_e_c_t_l_y.  Eventually,
     all unaligned accesses will be fixed, but in the meantime, just
     ignore these messages (if you're a programmer, please take a minute
     and fix the source of the unaligned access instead...).


     LLiinnkkeerr iissssuueess warning: using multiple gp values message:
        This is a warning message that is often issued by the linker
        when building a large program.  Unless you're into low-level
        hacking, you don't want to know what it means. The good news is:
        you can safely ignore this message and this warning will be
        optional in the future.

        The default configuration of the IDE driver disables interrupts
        for extended periods of time.  This causes the kernel to loose
        timer interrupts and as a result, time runs slow.  To avoid
        this, use the following command on all of the IDE drives in your
        system:


                          hdparm -u 1 /dev/hd?





     This reconfigures the IDE driver to re-enable interrupts as quickly
     as possible.

     minlabel,fdisk fail to update kernel partition table:
        Do not attempt to use a system after changing the partition
        table.  Even if minlabel and/or fdisk show the correct values
        you _w_i_l_l have to reboot the machine before the new values take
        effect.


     tar xvMf /dev/fd0 hangs.
        (This bug should not occur on GNU libc-based systems.)  Due to a
        bug in the malloc package that comes with libc-0.43, multi-
        volume tar archives do not work. Recompile and link with the
        gmalloc stand alone package, or get an updated libc.


     CClloocckk sseeeemmss ttoo bbee ooffff bbyy 2200 yyeeaarrss::
        This is not really a bug, but many people seem to have problems
        with it. Here's Jay Estabrook's Definitive Solution.


          ARC console and SRM console keep dates in the time-of-year (TOY) clock
          in slightly different formats (actually, only the "year" field differs).

          The "/sbin/clock" binary normally expects the format which SRM uses; you can,
          however, tell it to expect ARC format instead, using the "-A" flag.
          Thus, to read the clock when its kept in ARC format, say "clock -r -A", and
          to write it, "clock -w -A". If its not written in the expected format, the
          console (ARC or SRM) will prolly complain about it the next time it has a
          chance... :-\

          The best way to ensure you're using the correct format, is to set the date via
          the console's date-setting facility; under ARC, it's a menu item some place,
          under SRM it's a command (IIRC; try "help date").

          Then you must ensure that the "clock" call in the RH script
          /etc/rc.d/rc.sysconfig KNOWS WHAT FORMAT TO READ THE TOY IN!!!!

          If you're using ARC console to boot MILO/kernel, do:

          1. running RH 4.1, make sure /etc/sysconfig/clock contains:

                  CLOCKMODE="ARC"

          2. running RH 4.2, make sure /etc/sysconfig/clock contains (at least):

                  ARC=true

          Now, If you're using SRM console to directly boot a kernel, then:

          1. RH 4.1, same file, set CLOCKMODE=""

          2. RH 4.2, same file, set ARC=false

          Refer to /etc/rc.d/rc.sysconfig for details about how the above are used to
          call "clock" with the appropriate arguments.

        This occurs on the PC164/LX164/SX164 mainboards.  This is due to
        a slightly different version of the TOY clock hardware on these
        boards. As seen above, your system clock gets set from the TOY
        clock during bootup, using clock.  To test if your setup has
        this problem try the following command:
          while true; do /sbin/clock -r [-A]; done





     (use the -A option when your hardware TOY clock is in ARC format)
     If you see any inconsistent results, you need to upgrade your
     /sbin/clock. Get one of:

        Standard MILO images are configured to talk to the first serial
        port as well as the screen. When you have a modem connected it
        will talk back. To resolve this, either make sure your modem is
        turned off at boot time, connect it to a different port, or
        build your own MILO, disabling serial port echo.


     fdisk doesn't recognize my disk's partitions.
        This may occur when you're using BSD-style partitioning, e.g
        when partitioned using Digital Unix's disklabel utility. Just go
        into fdisk's BSD mode and you will be all right.


     vi handles keystrokes in batches of four
        In fact, other apps will show the same behavior: it really is a
        ncurses problem. It may be related to the termio vs. termios
        programming error described in the section below. A workaround
        is to issue stty eof '^a' before starting vi.

        Starting X fails with "Failed to set IOPL for I/O".  Cause: the
        stock 5.1 GLIBC doesn't recognize the RUFFIAN system type. This
        is fixed in most recent distributions if you still encounter
        this do _e_x_a_c_t_l_y the following (as root):


          ln -s EB164 /etc/alpha_systype





     For UP1000,UP1100 systems change the system type from above to
     Tsunami:


          ln -s Tsunami /etc/alpha_systype





     The following distributions are known to have this problem for the
     UP1000, UP1100: RedHat < 6.2, Debian < Woody.

     ipfwadm fails.
        RedHat 5.1 and 5.2 for Alpha shipped with a buggy ipfwadm. The
        common workaround is to use ipfwadm from RedHat 5.0. (Note: when
        you're running a 2.1.* or 2.2.* kernel you'll be using ipchains
        instead.)

        This seems to occur with Adaptec 2940 on PC164 in particular.
        Improvement has been reported after turning off the
        autodetection of device speed, width and termination. Get the
        utility from:


          http://www.windowsnt.digital.com/support/drivers/drivers.asp/





     Put it on a floppy, or any FAT partition, and select "Run a pro-
     gram" from the ARCBIOS menu. (Newer systems will allow you to con-
     figure SCSI controllers by running the onboard utility through the
     i386 emulator in the firmware.)

        When you forget to use the -A option when setting the hardware
        clock on an XL266, the ARCBIOS may see an invalid time, and
        refuse to boot any OS until this has been corrected.
        Unfortunately, when the setting is sufficiently invalid, it will
        not allow you to do so. (This is definitely a bug...) To recover
        you need a modified version of linload.exe. (Thanks to Juergen
        Schroeder this is available from <ftp://ftp.ub.uni-
        marburg.de/pub/unix/linux/alpha/linload_auto.exe>.)  Put it on a
        floppy, together with your favorite MILO, and use the "Run a
        Program" option to start it. Once in MILO you can boot linux,
        and set the clock again. Be sure to use -A this time...
        (I believe the modification to linload.exe is that the location
        of MILO is hardwired into the program.)

  Here is a somewhat random collection of popular ways of shooting
  yourself in the foot on Unix when programming in C.  This has
  practically nothing to do with Linux or Alpha, but since Linux/Alpha
  is among the pioneers in 64-bit land, these errors are more likely to
  show on such systems.


     sizeof(long)!=32
        Many programs assume a long is 32 bits wide.  This is non-sense.
        The ANSI C standard does not specify anything like that.  For
        example, on an Alpha running a grown up operating system such as
        DEC Unix or Linux, the fundamental C types have the following
        sizes and alignment restrictions:

     +o  char: 8 bits as usual, byte alignment is fine.

     +o  short: 16 bits as usual, 2 byte alignment required.

     +o  int: 32 bits as usual, 4 byte alignment required.


     +o  float: 32 bits as usual, 4 byte alignment required.

     +o  long: 64 bits, 8 byte alignment required.

     +o  void*: 64 bits, 8 byte alignment required.

     +o  double: 64 bits as usual, 4 byte alignment required.

        Note that the above implies that you cannot cast a pointer to an
        integer without loosing bits.  In fact, Alpha binaries by
        default are purposely arranged in such a way that if you try to
        do this, they'll dump core---it is much better to learn about
        such program errors via a core dump than through some subtle
        errors.

        If you need a variable with exactly _n bits in it, you can use
        the following types in Linux applications (and most other
        systems that are based on GNU libc):

     +o  int8_t: signed integer type with 8 bits.

     +o  int16_t: signed integer type with 16 bits.

     +o  int32_t: signed integer type with 32 bits.

     +o  int64_t: signed integer type with 64 bits.

     +o  u_int8_t: unsigned integer type with 8 bits.

     +o  u_int16_t: unsigned integer type with 16 bits.

     +o  u_int32_t: unsigned integer type with 32 bits.

     +o  u_int64_t: unsigned integer type with 64 bits.

        In the kernel, use the following types instead:

     +o  __s8: signed integer type with 8 bits.

     +o  __s16: signed integer type with 16 bits.

     +o  __s32: signed integer type with 32 bits.

     +o  __s64: signed integer type with 64 bits.

     +o  __u8: unsigned integer type with 8 bits.

     +o  __u16: unsigned integer type with 16 bits.

     +o  __u32: unsigned integer type with 32 bits.

     +o  __u64: unsigned integer type with 64 bits.

        However, the availability of these types is somewhat system
        dependent.  In particular, on a 32 bit machine, the 64 bit
        integers are typically available only when using GNU C.  Also,
        keep in mind that there are still machines out there that have
        odd word sizes, such as 36 bits.  So, for the sake of
        portability, these types should be used sparingly.


     EErrrroorr rreettuurrnn vvaalluuee ooff inet_addr()
        It is a common myth to assume that inet_addr() returns -1 in
        case of error.  In fact, even the Linux man-page propagates this
        superstitious belief.  But don't be misguided: in truth,
        inet_addr() returns INADDR_NONE in case of error.  This manifest
        constant is defined in netinet/in.h.  An even better solution is
        to avoid this function all together.  Reasonably modern
        libraries provide the inet_aton() function that has an
        unmistakable return value to indicate success or failure.


     struct termio does _n_o_t equal struct termios
        Many Linux programs incorrectly assume it is all right to mix
        and match struct termio and struct termios and their ioctl()
        calls.  Well, not quite.  The two interfaces are in fact
        incompatible on many systems (for historic reasons, this can't
        be fixed easily).  Thus, if you use struct termio, then be sure
        to use the termio calls _o_n_l_y (TCGETA, TCSETAF, TCSETAW, and
        TCSETA).  In contrast, if you use the termios structure, be sure
        to use its calls only (TCGETS, TCSETSF, TCSETSW, and TCSETS).


     AAttoommiicciittyy ooff ssuubb--wwoorrdd llooaaddss//ssttoorreess
        It is generally not safe to assume that reading or writing a
        quantity that is smaller than the machine's word size is atomic.
        In particular, all early Alpha chips do not have atomic
        instructions to read or write a byte or a short (16 bits).
        Unless you're into kernel hacking where you need to synchronize
        with devices and/or interrupts, you probably won't care.  But
        even in user-space this can cause problems in case your program
        is sharing data with another process through shared memory, for
        example.

  Linux/Alpha is known to run on machines with as little as 8MB of RAM
  and a 170MB harddisk.  In those 8MB of RAM, you can run Emacs-19.28
  without swapping, but that's about it.  A system with 16MB RAM and
  500MB is perfectly reasonable to work with, even when using X11. 32MB
  RAM and on the order of 1GB of disk should satisfy even power-hungry
  users, though, as usually is the case: the more the better.


  (Well, I guess one's perception of what is reasonable can change with
  time, and with DRAM prices. I know that by now many people would
  consider 32MB the bare minimum, 64MB usable. Recent releases of RedHat
  seem to need at least 24MB just to install...
  And you'll have a hard time looking for a hard disk smaller than 2GB.)


  Note that, though many Alpha mainboards support EIDE, performance is
  reported to be unsatisfactory. SCSI is recommended.



  44..  HHooww ffaasstt iiss tthhee AAllpphhaa ??

  This depends on the type of system you have, and what you are trying
  to do.


  The Alpha is a RISC processor: it has fewer and simpler instructions.
  Thus, at the same clockspeed, it will generally be slower than a CISC
  processor. But, being simpler, it will be easier to build processors
  that run at higher speeds.  The fastest Alpha (now at 833MHz) will
  outpace the fastest Intel processor (1 GHz.) This will remain true for
  many years to come. (It will also be more expensive.)


  In BogoMIPS, Alpha's up to the 164 show a speed approximately equal to
  the clock frequency in MHz (like Intel's 486 and early Pentium
  processors.) The 264 has a BM value of twice the clock speed (like
  Pentium MMX and higher.)
  This, however can not be taken as a true indication of the speed for
  real applications.


  RISC instructions are fewer and simpler, so you need to execute more
  of them to get the same amount of work done. On top of that, they are
  also larger.  So, to keep your Alpha running at full speed, you need
  large caches and high memory bandwidth. Most Alpha's have two levels
  of cache on chip, and the newer boards also provide wide (128 or 256
  bit) memory busses. Some of the older Alpha systems, however, do
  suffer from lack of memory bandwidth.


  The Alpha has earned itself a reputation for floating point
  performance.  However, it takes a very good compiler and libraries to
  achieve the optimum.  Until recently, this meant that the real
  numbercrunchers would often revert to Digital Unix. Recently, though
  the compilers in the Open Source arena still lag behind, large
  improvements have been made w.r.t. the libraries and compilers. Compaq
  has ported the Tru64 (Digital Unix) compilers and math libraries
  <http://www.compaq.com/products/software/linux/> over to Linux. They
  are available for free download for academic and personal use,
  commercial use does require purchasing a license.

  The number of Alpha platforms that are supported by Linux is quickly
  increasing. The following is a list of workstations and motherboards
  that are known to work with Linux.  If you have any corrections to the
  list, please send us <mailto:docs@alphalinux.org> mail.  More
  information on these system types is also available at the
  AlphaLinux.org documentation archives
  <http://www.alphalinux.org/docs>.


  +o

     EESS4400 <<http://www.compaq.com/alphaserver/es40/index.html> The ES40
     is currently one of the largest Alpha machines that runs Linux.
     It's available with 1-4 500MHz CPUs with 4MB of cache or 1-4 667MHz
     CPUs with 8MB of DDR cache, and supports up to 32Gig of memory.
     Linux kernels for these machines should be compiled as either
     Generic or DP264.


  +o

     DDSS1100 <<http://www.compaq.com/alphaserver/ds10/index.html> DS10L <
     http://www5.compaq.com/alphaserver/ds10l/index.html> The difference
     between the DS10 and the DS10L is that the L version is a 1U rack-
     mountable unit, whereas the standard DS10 is a desktop box. These
     are based on the Tsunami chipset and have CPUs at either 466 or
     600MHz, with 2MB of cache.  Linux kernels for these machines should
     be compiled as either Generic or DP264.


  +o

     XXPP11000000 aanndd XXPP990000 <<http://www.digital.com/alphaserver/workstations/>
     These are the last true workstation products to come out of
     Digital/Compaq. From now on all the workstations will use the same
     parts as the servers. The XP1000 is sold with either a 500MHz
     (Monet) or 667MHz (Brisbane) CPU and both are based on the Tsunami
     chipset.. The XP900 is sold as a VMS workstation.  Linux kernels
     for these machines should be compiled as either Generic or DP264.


  +o

     UUPP11000000 <<http://www.api-networks.com/products/up1000-board.shtml>
     and UP1100 <http://www.api-
     networks.com/products/up1100-board.shtml> Products of Alpha
     Processor Inc (now API NetWorks Inc). Both are based around the AMD
     Irongate system controller and can take up 768MB of memory (3slots,
     PC100 Unbuffered ECC 168Pin DIMMs). The UP1000 uses API's slot B
     and can accommodate either a 600MHz 2MB or 700MHz 4MB slotB. The
     UP1100 has a 600MHz processor soldered to the board and a 2MB cache
     (all the CPUs uses in both boards are EV67).  The UP1100 also has
     UDMA66 support (UP1000 has UDMA33), onboard sound (use the trident
     driver is 2.2.16 or later) and an onboard 21143 (tulip) ethernet
     controller. Both boards also have dual serial, parallel and dual
     USB (yes, the USB does work under Linux).  Linux kernels for these
     machines should be compiled as either Generic or Nautilus.


  +o

     UUPP22000000 aanndd UUPP22000000++ <<http://www.api-
     networks.com/products/up2000-board.shtml> Another product of Alpha
     Processor Inc, now API NetWorks Inc. They are very similar to the
     DP264 series except that they can only take 2Gig of RAM (8 Slots,
     uses PC100 Registered ECC 168Pim DIMMs) and have a different SCSI
     controller (Adaptec Ultra2Wide). Instead of using the daugthercard
     approach that the DP264 uses, the UP2000 and UP2000+ use the API
     SlotB which contains the processor, cache and VRM. SlotBs for these
     boards are available in the following configs: 600MHz 2MB, 667MHz
     2MB, 667MHz 4MB, 750MHz 4MB, 750MHz 8MB and 833MHz 4MB (DDR cache,
     UP2000+ only).  Linux kernels for these machines should be compiled
     as either Generic or DP264.


  +o

     DDPP226644 <<http://www.api-networks.com/products/264dp-board.shtml> and
     DS20/DS20E <http://www5.compaq.com/alphaserver/ds20e/index.html>
     The DP264 and DS20 are dual EV6 (or EV67) machines based on
     Tsunami. The DP264 is the OEM version and is almost functionally
     the same. They support up to 4Gig of memory using PC100 Registered
     ECC 200 Pin DIMMs with 16 slots. They also have onboard Adaptec
     SCSI (Ultra Wide) and support speeds of 500 or 667 (500s have
     either 2 or 4MB or cache, 667 has either 4MB (Samsung) or 8MB of
     DDR cache (Compaq)).  Linux kernels for these machines should be
     compiled as either Generic or DP264.

     AAllpphhaaPPCC 116644UUXX <<http://www.api-networks.com/products/164ux-
     board.shtml> Interestingly, this is not a Digital product. It was
     developed by Deskstation, (called RUFFIAN then), and is now being
     sold by Samsung. It supports speeds up to 800 MHz, and comes with
     on-board Ultra Wide SCSI (Symbios Logic 53C875), and 10/100 Mb
     Ethernet (Digital 21143).  Like the 164SX an LX, it uses DIMMs
     (SDRAM) for memory, but it has 6 slots rather then 4.


  +o

     AAllpphhaaPPCC 116644LLXX <<http://www.dec.com/semiconductor/alpha/dsc-
     pc164lx.html> is Digital's best bet. It's based on the AAllpphhaaPPCC 116644,
     but with speeds up to 600 MHz, and using DIMMs rather than SIMMs.
     (i.e. SDRAM rather then DRAM.)


  +o

     The low end of the EV5  generation is the AAllpphhaaPPCC 116644SSXX
     <<http://www.digital.com/semiconductor/alpha/dsc-pc164sx.html>. It
     uses the 21164PC variant of the Alpha microprocessor, at 400 or 533
     MHz. This board is targeted at the NT Workstation market, but it
     will run Linux just fine.


  +o

     For a complete Workstation you may want to look at MMiiaattaa (Personal
     Workstation). This comes with a Graphics Card (Powerstorm) for
     which X11 support does not (yet) exist, but Matrox Millennium is a
     popular replacement.


  +o

     AAllccoorr ((AASS660000)),, BBrreett ((AASS550000)).  The Alcor kernel is supposed to work
     fine with the AlphaStation 500 as well.  If you can confirm this,
     please let us know.
  +o

     EEBB116644.  The Aspen Timberline and Summit machines are similar to
     this machine/motherboard.  The EB164 has been replaced by the PC164
     and it's successors (see above).


  +o

     CCaabbrriioolleett ((aakkaa AAllpphhaaPPCC6644)):: This is a PCI-bus based motherboards
     using the 21064 Alpha CPU.  It is more pricey than the 21066
     systems but it does make for a real nice system and many third-
     party products are based on this design.  This board typically runs
     at 275MHz but some vendors sell an (overclocked) 300MHz version. It
     really is historical now, but you may be able to find them at very
     attractive prices.


  +o

     MMiikkaassaa (AlphaServer 1000).  Noritake (AlphaServer 1000a) is
     supported as well, if you use kernels 2.0.30 or higher, with the
     appropriate patches. However, the builtin Cirrus graphics card is
     not (or very poorly) supported by X11.


  +o

     MMuussttaanngg ((AASS220000)),,MM33 ((AASS225500)),,((AASS225555)),,AAvvaannttii ((AASS440000)) :: Linux now runs
     on all of these AlphaStations.  The reason for clumping all these
     machines together is that they are all very similar to program.  In
     particular, they all can run one and the same kernel when booted
     using the same firmware.  Thus, when configuring a kernel, simply
     pick "Avanti" as the system type since that covers all of the above
     machines.


  +o

     XXLL The XL machine is also know as the "Windows NT Dream Machine."
     Well, for what it's worth, (most of them) are perfectly happy
     running Linux.

     The regular XL is based on the 21064 CPU and runs either at 233 or
     266MHz with 512KB or 2MB of second level cache, respectively.

     The newer XL Turbo <http://www.digital.com/info/CU3102/> is based
     on the 21164A CPU and runs either at 300 or 366MHz.  The Turbo
     always comes with 2MB of second-level cache.


  +o

     AALLPPHHAAbbooookk 11 The ALPHAbook 1 is a 21066A based notebook (the first
     and only portable Alpha, so far).  Linux works fine on this machine
     with a few extra patches.  An X server is available for this
     machine as well.


  +o

     JJeennsseenn <<http://www.alphalinux.org/docs/jensen.shtml> (aka DEC 2000
     aka DECpc AXP 150): This is the oldest of all Alpha PCs and comes
     with an EISA bus.  You probably don't want to buy such a machine
     new anymore since you can now get faster machines for less money.
     However, it is not uncommon to get really amazing deals for these
     machines and a Jensen definitively would make a nice home box.  The
     firmware seems a little picky about what graphics card and SCSI
     controllers it wants, but if you're just looking for an affordable
     Alpha box, it might be worthwhile to look into it.


  +o

     NNoonnaammee ((aakkaa AAXXPPppccii3333)):: This is a PCI-bus based motherboard using
     the 21066 Alpha CPU (Low-Cost Alpha).  The core of the 21066 is the
     same as the 21064.  The only difference is that the 21066 also has
     a memory and I/O controller integrated into the chip (which has the
     effect that the external interface is much simpler and therefore
     much cheaper).  This board is available in a 166 and a 233MHz
     version.


  +o

     UUDDBB <<http://www.alphalinux.org/docs/udb-multia.shtml>: Linux/Alpha
     also runs well on the Universal Desktop Box.  (That's the box
     that's called "Multia" when it's running Windows NT.)  The TGA
     graphics card and the builtin soundcard are supported.  The UDB is
     basically a Noname board with more hardware builtin and wrapped
     into a neat little box.  So when configuring a kernel for it,
     simply select the "Noname" system type.  The UDB currently provides
     the lowest-cost entry point into the Alpha world.


  +o

     EEBB**:: Digital used to sell various other evaluation boards (e.g.,
     EB66, EB64+, etc.). Reportedly, Linux/Alpha may run on some of
     these.  But they were relatively pricey and should now be
     considered obsolete.

  Linux/Alpha is unlikely to support the TURBOchannel-based Alpha
  systems in the near (or any) future (this is the DEC 3000 series of
  workstations).  The reason for this is two-fold: first, these machines
  have an I/O system that is very different from PCI-based machines and
  therefore do not look anything like PCs (e.g., pretty much all drivers
  would have to be written from scratch).  Second, with the advent of
  PCI, the TURBOchannel is pretty much dead technology (for better or
  worse) and it just isn't all that much fun to develop software for
  dead technology (on the other hand, it may soon be possible to buy
  such systems cheaply, which would make them more interesting to Linux
  users, I suppose).

  If you have such a machine and want to run a free OS, look for the
  *BSD's. At least one of them supports the 3000 series.

  Most of the Alpha motherboards sold today go through Samsung and API
  NetWorks.  Samsung handles some of the sales for Asia where API
  NetWorks, Inc. <http://www.api-networks.com> handles the Americas and
  Europe.

  In general, it's likely that buying a complete system will actually be
  cheaper than putting one together yourself.  This is especially true
  for many of the third-party systems and for Digital's XL machines.  If
  you add the costs of all the components to the price of the
  motherboard, you'll quickly find that it's difficult to beat those
  prices.  The good news about this is of course that it will also save
  you the trouble of having to find appropriate parts.  A number of
  third-party vendors can be found through the AlphaPowered
  <http://www.alphapowered.com> page. They typically offer
  configurations based on 164LX and 164SX boards, but some may have nice
  deals on the older boards as well.


  Linux will also run on some of Digital's server-class systems. Check
  the table in the previous chapter.

  This section provides some more information on the Noname motherboard.
  There are some hints and tips that you might be interested in if
  you're considering putting together a system on your own.

  First off, here is what the Noname board looks like: picture of Noname
  board <http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/axppci/small_pci33.gif>.

  This section also includes standard benchmark performance results,
  which might help give you an idea of how a Noname system performs.

  Before going out and purchasing such a machine, please be aware that
  the Noname really is a low-end machine and as such is relatively low
  performance. The Noname _c_a_n make for a nice machine (especially
  together with a TGA graphics card), but be sure to run the
  applications you care about before making a purchase decision.  Rather
  then putting together a system based on this board, it is currently
  much cheaper to get a Universal Desktop Box (UDB
  <http://www.annex.co.uk/systems/udb.html>).  That box is basically a
  Noname with lots of very nice builtin hardware. The last UDB's are now
  being sold at $ 99,-.

  You will need the OSF/1 PALcode to run Linux.  Digital has made the
  firmware available for ftp so you can download the SRM console from
  Digital's ftp site <ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/axppci>. There are
  two serious drawbacks with the SRM console: it eats away 2-3MB of RAM
  and older versions ccaannnnoott boot from IDE drives.  With newer machines
  2-3MB of memory is not all that significant, and IDE is support on
  newer platforms. Fortunately, the free MILO
  <http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/milo.html> replacement firmware doesn't
  suffer from these problems.  Plus with MILO, you get all the sources!

  +o   KKeeyybbooaarrdd


     If you plan on running DEC Unix (formerly known as OSF/1), you have
     to get a board with a PS/2 style connector.  On the other hand, it
     seems a lot easier/cheaper to find cases and keyboards for AT-style
     connectors.  (Nekotech seems to be shipping Noname motherboards
     with the PS/2 connectors on a slot-bracket which allows you to have
     the best of both worlds: a regular (cheap) AT-case without having
     to tie up a serial port for the mouse.)

     The only difference between the PS/2 and AT-style keyboard
     interface is the keyboard ccoonnnneeccttoorr. The electrical interface is
     identical.  In fact, you can buy AT to PS/2 converters in any
     computer shop for a few bucks.  The advantage of PS/2-style board
     is that there is a second connector that can be used for a PS/2
     mouse (i.e., no need to tie up a serial port with a serial mouse).
     But then again: economy of scale currently works in the direction
     that serial mice are dirt cheap and omni-present, which can't be
     said about PS/2 mice.


  +o  MMeemmoorryy


     Be careful about what kind of SIMMs you get.  In particular,
     "logical parity" SIMMs ddoo nnoott work.  What you should get is 70ns
     memory with 36bits/SIMM.  These are also known as ECC SIMMs.
     Please refer to the OEM Design Guide for details.

     Also notice that some of the firmware simply _r_e_f_u_s_e_s to boot with
     anything less than 16MB of RAM installed.  Older versions of the
     SRM console used to do that and the ARC console apparently has the
     same bad habit.  MILO and any reasonably recent release of the SRM
     console should boot fine in 8MB, however.

  They should and, as far as we can tell, they really do work.  Besides
  the drivers for the on-board interfaces, several other ISA cards are
  known to work already (e.g., depca and ne2000 Ethernet cards, sound
  cards, internal modems, etc.).  Notice that the SRM console includes a
  configuration command called "isacfg" that allows to setup the PCI/ISA
  bridge.  That command has an undocumented option enadev that allows to
  enable the ISA card.

  to be less tuned at this point, but it gives you an idea of where the
  hardware stands.

  The Jensen was the first Alpha PC that has been available commercially
  from DEC.  Not surprisingly, there are a few oddities with it.  This
  section is an attempt to help people getting Linux/Alpha installed on
  a Jensen, and to provide additional information operating Linux on the
  Jensen.


  99..11..  IInnssttaallllaattiioonn

  First off, there is no MILO for the Jensen.  So it is unavoidable to
  use Jensen's builtin SRM <http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/srm.html>
  console.  Unfortunately, it is severely handicapped with respect to
  boot command line option processing.  Thanks to Michael Schwingen
  <mailto:michaels@stochastik.rwth-aachen.de> there is now a new aboot
  <ftp://ftp.alphalinux.org/pub/aboot> loader that can work around these
  limitations.
  Secondly, the Jensen SRM console cannot boot from a floppy. This used
  to make bootstrapping Linux a real pain, until Jim Paradis
  <mailto:paradis@amt.tay1.dec.com> contributed a minilabel and
  writeboot programs executable from the ARC console. These tools can be
  download from the AlphaLinux.Org Jensen Page
  <http://www.alphalinux.org/docs/jensen.shtml>.


  The original version --  wwhhiicchh iiss oouuttddaatteedd aanndd yyoouu sshhoouulldd nnoott uussee tthhiiss
  nnooww -- is available together with a the JENSEN-HOWTO describing the
  installation process in detail from ftp.digital.com
  <ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/ARCHIVES/JENSEN_INSTALL/>.

  The Jensen is supported by Red Hat Linux <http://www.redhat.com>, but
  some things still cause trouble.


  99..22..  TThhee JJeennsseenn iiss ddiiffffeerreenntt

  The Jensen differs from other systems in several ways:


  +o  NNoo MMIILLOO.. It was already stated that there is no MILO for the
     Jensen. This is because the firmware implementation of the Jensen
     differs somewhat from the one on other systems. _P_A_L_c_o_d_e is the
     keyword to look for, if your interested to know more.

  +o  EEIISSAA--BBuuss.. The Jensen has only got an EISA bus, no PCI. Furthermore,
     it uses a very special addressing scheme for the bus. While the
     kernel usually takes care of that in respect to device drivers, it
     has to be taken care of by utilities that do i/o in user space,
     like the X servers. Therefore you need special support from the X
     server, which is  available in XFree86 version 3.3 (or later) for
     S3 cards, available from www.xfree86.org <http://www.xfree86.org/>.
     You'll also find other useful stuff there, ported by Stephan
     Kanthak <http://www.informatik.rwth-
     aachen.de/I6/Colleagues/kanthak/Jensen/jensen_fan_page.html>, like
     a ported SVGAlib.

     If you're interested in details, watch for the keywords  _S_P_A_R_S_E _v_s
     _D_E_N_S_E _m_e_m_o_r_y.


     NNoottee:: Only S3 based cards are supported. The Compaq QVision, which
     is one of the graphic cards originally  shipped by Digital, is nnoott
     currently not supported by XFree86, and support for it is unlikely
     to occur at all.


  +o  RRTTCC.. Somehow it was managed to locate the real time clock at a
     different place (I/O port 0x170 instead of 0x70 on all other
     machines). Thus the original clock program will fail. A patched
     version is available from Martin Ostermann's Alpha Page
     <http://www.comnets.rwth-aachen.de/~ost/alpha/alpha.html>.

  +o  FFiirrmmwwaarree.. Since the Jensen is the oldest machine around, there are
     chances that you got a very old firmware. The date format changed
     in newer version, which will cause an offset of 20 years. You ought
     to get a firmware update <http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Linux-
     Alpha/ARCHIVES/JENSEN_INSTALL/jensen_firmware_procedure.html>.
     WARNING: If you own an ELSA-Winner 1000 graphics adapter, don't
     update beyond version 1.7!  Otherwise you'll not be able to use
     your card in EISA mode. This is probably due to a bug in the EISA
     BIOS of the card.


  99..33..  KKnnoowwnn PPrroobblleemmss

  Know Problem and workarounds:

  +o  DDaattee aanndd TTiimmee.. Due to the location of the real time clock and/or an
     old firmware. See above.

  +o  WWoonn''tt bboooott aafftteerr ffiirrmmwwaarree uuppddaattee.. Aboot doesn't work with new
     firmwares. It is known to work with versions up to 1.7
     <http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Linux-
     Alpha/ARCHIVES/JENSEN_INSTALL/jensen_firmware_procedure.html>.
     If you own an ELSA-Winner 1000  graphics adapter and upgraded
     beyond firmware version 1.7, the card won't work in EISA mode. Turn
     the card, so that it is plugged in with its ISA side.
     Maybe you want to downgrade you firmware again. (Windows-NT 3.51
     and 4.0 seem to work fine with firmware 1.7) This version
     <http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Linux-
     Alpha/ARCHIVES/JENSEN_INSTALL/jensen_firmware_procedure.html> is
     now available from Digital's FTP server.

  +o  aabboooott--00..xx ddooeessnn''tt ccoommppiillee oonn rreecceenntt kkeerrnneellss..  Get aboot-0.4 or
     above, it works with recent kernels.

  +o  WWoonn''tt aauuttoommaattiicc rreebboooott aafftteerr ccoorrrreecctt sshhuuttddoowwnn.. Known problem, with
     2.0.x kernels. Apparently this has been solved with recent 2.1.x
     kernels. I tried 2.1.88, and rebooting worked. But that kernel
     version had other problems.

  +o  SSeeccoonndd sseerriiaall ppoorrtt iiss uunnuussaabbllee..  Accessing '/dev/cua1' will freeze
     the system immediately. You may test this by issuing 'cat
     /dev/cua1', but I suggest that you put your file-systems in read-
     only mode first. In case you need more serial ports, it is no
     problem to install an additional serial buffer card. In case you
     need this for a modem, you ought to do that anyway, because  the
     builtin ports are unbuffered (16450 compatible), not buffered ones
     (16550!).

  Sometimes people tend to blame the Jensen for general Alpha related
  problems. Please keep in mind that only the hardware is different, and
  that in most cases the kernel handles the hardware access. Thus for
  most programs it doesn't make a difference if they are being run on
  the Jensen or any other Digital/Alpha machine.


  99..44..  HHaarrddwwaarree IIssssuueess

  You may ask yourself, how you can upgrade your system. Here are some
  suggestions, but please note that I actually ddiidd nnoott test most of this
  stuff, I just collected information found on the internet:


  +o  RRAAMM uuppddaatteess..  4 MB, 8MB (dual-RAS aka doublesided), 16 MB, and 32
     MB SIMMs produced as late as summer of 96 have been reported to
     work, but I do not know if a certain refresh cycles is required.
     Note that you need  3366 bbiitt ttrruuee ppaarriittyy SIMMs (but only one of the 4
     parity bits on each SIMM is actually used, as Michael Schwingen
     confirmed).

  +o  VViiddeeoo ccaarrdd..  Basically any VGA ISA or EISA card mmaayy work. Most
     actually do, if you use the ARC console and Windows NT.
     Unfortunately, the SRM console, which you need to boot Linux, is
     somewhat picky about the cards it supports. It uses an Intel-x86
     emulation to initialize the card via its VGA-BIOS, and that one
     seems to be buggy.
     If you want to run X, you need an S3 based card. Any S3 card (but,
     nnoott S3-Virge, etc), which has been accepted by the SRM console,
     should work. Look at the XFree documentation for the XF86S3 driver
     for detailed information.

  These boxes have become quite popular recently because they are now
  available cheaply (Digital is clearing out the warehouse ??) which
  makes them the successor to the UDB as a lower end way into the Alpha
  world. Onsale <http://www.onsale.com> and Webauction
  <http://www.webauction.com> are the places to get them.


  Rick Taylor (Charles E. Taylor IV <mailto:charlet@hubcap.clemson.edu>)
  supplied the following details:



     CCPPUU
        The AS200 comes with 21064 or 21064A CPUs. Speeds are 166MHz and
        233 MHz.  The support chipset is the 21071-AA.

     ccaacchhee
        Apart from the on-chip cache, there is 512K of cache on the
        mainboard.

     mmeemmoorryy
        There are 6 slots for 72 pin true parity SIMMs. Slots must be
        filled in pairs. According to the specs, 384 megs of RAM can be
        added. The items from Onsale seem to come with 16 MB. You may
        want to add some before installing Linux.

     ddiisscc
        The base configuration does not include any discs...

     vviiddeeoo
        .. nor a graphics card. Any Alpha supported PCI video card
        should work: S3Virge DX (4MB) and S3Trio64V2 (2MB) definitely
        do.




  Some more quotes from Rich's mail:


  +o  "As with most of these older Alphas, upgrading the firmware is all
     but a necessity to install Linux.  Mine came with an older SRM that
     just wouldn't load the Linux kernel without locking, and upgrading
     to the latest ARC fixed the problem.  Mine came from the batch of
     Alphas that onsale and webauction have been (and still are, in the
     case of webauction) selling, so I'd assume other new AS200 owners
     might have similar problems."

  +o  "To get the builtin sound card to work you need to recompile the
     kernel on RedHat.  Fairly simple, but I just talked a guy through
     it on the RedHat-AXP list, so I thought I'd mention it. :)"

  +o  "Something that surprised me when I first installed (before I
     hooked the machine into the local ethernet network and while I was
     using PPP): my modem wouldn't work on the first com port.  I
     suspect that had something to do with the serial console setting.
     The symptom was the modem constantly getting traffic when no
     program should have been talking to it.  Not too tough to figure
     out, but it could be rather confusing to someone who didn't get the
     documentation with their machine.  A quick fix is to simply use the
     other com port for the modem."

  +o  "My AS200 came with something of an oddity - an ISA card with two
     PCMCIA slots on it.  According to the DEC shipping label it was an
     option, but as I don't have any PCMCIA devices, I removed the card
     from the machine and put it in storage.  I'm not sure if/how the
     card works in Linux, and I didn't get any documentation for the
     card, so I don't have much information on it."

  The Ruffian board is broadly similar to the 164LX board, but beefed up
  with six DIMM slots instead of four (giving a maximum memory capacity
  of 1536MB), and with on-board SCSI and ethernet.  It also takes
  higher-clocked EV56 processors (up to 667MHz) and has more PCI slots.

  While the vast majority have no trouble with their Ruffians (author
  included), a handful of users find fundamental shortcomings that make
  the board unusable for their applications.

  A virtual memory stress-test that induces continuous heavy paging can
  cause the machine to die.  The problem manifests itself through
  various "Unable to handle kernel paging request", "killing the
  swapper", "attempting to swap the idle process" messages, and a
  register dump.  The system may become unusable after that.


  The stress-test may run without failure (I have run it for three days
  without fault), or it may fail within seconds.


  Some people claim this problem only arises with large memory
  configurations.

  Lukasz Dobrek <mailto:dobrek@itp.uni-hannover.de> of Hannover
  University has identified that his processor has been overheating and
  believes that this has been causing the problems described above.  He
  put some silicon paste between processor and heatsink and found that
  his machine became stable again.  Silicon paste is an interface
  material that improves heat transfer between surfaces.
  Other people have suggested that the problem is aggravated in large
  memory configurations.


  Elsewhere it has been suggested that using the latest milo will help
  improve stability.

  The Ruffian's on-board DEC Tulip Ethernet is not very good at auto-
  sensing a 100Mbit link with the Linux Tulip driver.  Using recent
  versions of the tulip driver appears to help.  The author has also
  found the problem to be sensitive to the network hardware.  By
  changing hubs, or even ports on the same hub, the problem disappears.


  The tulip device driver page is well documented at:

  +o  <http://www.scyld.com/network/tulip.html>


  These pages also contain instructions on how to install the driver.
  Alternatively, try looking at the section on building your own kernel
  in this FAQ. (The location of the tulip device driver in the linux
  source tree is drivers/net/tulip.c, copy your newly-downloaded version
  in here and you're ready to build)


  If your ethernet doesn't autosense 100Mbit, there are some other
  options I have found to sometimes work, although we're in experimental
  territory here and what may work for me may not work for you.


  Your first option is to hard-code your ethernet interface to be
  100baseTX, bypassing the autosensing mechanism. However, this doesn't
  always work. What does sometimes work is hard-coding the medium to be
  10Mbit, and then 100Mbit.  The first packet will fail transmission,
  but after that the link is brought up in 100Mbit mode. To bypass the
  auto-sensing mechanism, edit tulip.c and put numbers into the options
  array, according to your media type as defined in an array further
  down the code (10baseT is 12, 100baseT is 4). If you still can't get
  this to work, try this patched version of the tulip driver, actually
  patched for the Miata by Loic Prylli. What it does is to keep trying
  with user-specified hard-coded media.


  Again, your experience may vary...

  Older versions of MILO (the bootloader) required that the video card
  was put into the 64-bit slot.  This was because all the other PCI
  slots are behind a PCI-PCI bridge which was not correctly supported by
  MILO.


  However, work by Nikita Schmidt and Stefan Reinauer have addressed
  this problem and recent MILOs support a video card in any PCI slot,
  freeing that 64-bit slot up for better things...


  You can find Nikita's work here <ftp://genie.ucd.ie/pub/alpha/milo/>
  and Stefan's work here <http://www.suse.de/~stepan/>.  Stefan's work
  builds upon the improvements done by Nikita on the stock MILO
  available from Compaq at the Gatekeeper FTP site above.

  If your graphics card uses the SVGA X-server (eg, if you have a Matrox

  The Ruffian ARCSBIOS uses a different format for time and date. In
  releases of Red Hat up to 5.1, this meant that Linux would not report
  the correct date and time.


  This can be fixed using:

  +o  An updated version of the clock binary (try gatekeeper),

  +o  by getting your date and time from another system on the network
     using rdate -s,

  +o  or by using xntpd.


  Date and time issues are fixed for the Ruffian in Red Hat 5.2

  Unfortunately the Ruffian kernel provided on the Red Hat 5.2 CD
  doesn't contain support for the Symbios 875 on-board SCSI. However,
  you can take the kernel image from Red Hat 5.1 to perform the install.
  Once installed, you can build your own kernel - the sources on
  <ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/Kernels> for 2.0.35 are
  tried and trusted.

  Linux/Alpha supports both DEC's TGA and generic VGA cards.  The new
  PowerStorm cards from DEC are not supported yet.


  1122..11..  TTGGAA CCaarrdd

  TGA is DEC's (first) family of workstation graphics cards for the PCI
  bus.  It makes for nice and very quick cards.  The only drawback is
  that since it is coming from the workstation market, it does _n_o_t
  support 16-bit color mode.

  There are three versions of the TGA card.  They are all based on the
  21030 chip:


       Model:  Description:
       ZLXp-E1  8-plane TGA (256 colors)
       ZLXp-E2 24-plane TGA (16 million colors)
       ZLXp-E3 24-plane TGA + 32-plane Zbuffer (16 million colors and 3D support)




  Caveat: as described below, only the ZLXp-E1 is currently supported by
  an X server.


  1122..22..  VVGGAA CCaarrddss

  Linux boots in VGA mode, so pretty much any graphics card should do
  for Linux.  However, the graphics card also needs to work with the
  firmware.  This is non-trivial since many PCI cards need proprietary
  wakeup sequences to bring them into a VGA compatible mode.  To solve
  this problem, the firmware includes an x86 emulator that is used to
  execute the BIOS initialization code on the graphics card.  In theory,
  it is therefore possible plug in any PC graphics card.

  DEC implemented an x86 emulator that is used by the MILO (Linux), SRM
  (DEC Unix), and ARC (Windows NT) firmware.  This emulator is mature
  and can indeed initialize most, if not all, cards.  To be on the safe
  side, take a look at the hardware-compatibility lists for DEC Unix and
  Windows NT before deciding on a card.

  MILO also comes with an (optional) emulator that is free.  It is not
  nearly as mature as DEC's emulator, but it nevertheless is able to
  initialize at least following graphics cards:
       bus card type:                  chip:   BIOS version:                   Note:

  According to the XFree 3.3.3.1 Release Notes:


       The following X servers are available for Alpha hardware:

                 XMa64.tgz       Mach 64 server
                 XMono.tgz       Mono server (generic driver only)

                 XS3V.tgz        old S3 ViRGE server (please use SVGA server)
                 XSVGA.tgz       SVGA server (Matrox Millennium and S3 ViRGE drivers only)




  The S3 server is known to work with 764x, 805, 864, 928 based cards
  (e.g., Orchid Fahrenheit 1280, #9 GXE64, #9 Level 12, #9 Motion 771).
  The Mach64 server is known to work with WinTurbo GX-VRAM and Graphics
  Xpression CX-DRAM cards.


  These servers are available from  <ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/>.  More
  recent developments are available from SuSE <http://www.suse.com/>.
  Check out the section on commercial software for other options.


  For TGA not just one, but two servers exist: the first one is by the
  XFree project, as mentioned above. It's relatively young so it's not
  well-optimized yet, but it's definitively usable and since sources are
  available for it, anybody can improve it.
  based on DEC-proprietary code (sources are not available). It is fast
  and relatively stable and can be found here

  The firmware can be controlled over a serial line terminal at 9600
  Baud and it is possible to boot Linux/Alpha in that manner. The kernel
  can also handle being booted headless without any trouble. Make sure
  to pass the kernel the device name of the console you wish to use.
  For example if you wanted to redirect the console to the first serial
  port, you would add 'console=ttyS0' to the list of flags sent to the
  kernel.


  The other important thing to remember here is that by default there is
  no getty spawned on the serial ports. You must add a line like this to
  the /etc/inittab to be able to login on the serial port(s):



  S1:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty ttyS0




  Then force init to reread its configuration file with:

  init q



  By default you also can not login as root over the serial port. To add
  this ability add the serial port(s) (ttyS0 and/or ttyS1) to the
  /etc/securetty file.

  Red Hat is distributing the Alpha version of its well-known Linux
  distribution.  Red Hat for Alpha is ELF-based and available both on
  CD-ROM and via ftp.  The distribution uses the RPM system (Red Hat
  Package Manager) which allows easy installation of both sources and
  binaries.  Besides installing packages, it also allows to keep track
  of what's installed and it can even uninstall packages that you don't
  like anymore.  But Red Hat is a lot more than just RPM.  Be sure to
  check their web site <http://www.redhat.com/> for all the details.

  The Red Hat distribution is available via ftp from the Red Hat site
  <ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/>. Version 6.2 has been available for some
  time now and 7.0 should soon be released, be sure to download the
  errata as well.  Mirror sites <http://www.redhat.com/mirrors.html> all
  over the world are available as well.

  It seems that a distribution for Alpha is also being prepared by
  Stampede <http://www.stampede.org>.


  SuSE has also started releasing their Linux distribution for Alpha
  (starting with 6.1). The Alpha version is usually released a couple of
  weeks after the i386 port. SuSE can be found on the web at
  www.suse.com <http://www.suse.com>.


  TurboLinux (formerly Pacific HiTech) has recently started porting
  their distribution over to Alpha. The first version being 6.0, they
  can be found on the web at www.turbolinux.com
  <http://www.turbolinux.com>.


  1133..44..  SSoouurrcceess

  The Linux/Alpha homepage contains a list of ftp sites and mirrors that
  are used by the developers to make the latest and greatest version of
  various programs available.  The Linux/Alpha home page is located at
  www.alphalinux.org <http://www.alphalinux.org>.

  Of course, the regular Linux ftp sites such as
  <ftp://sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux> or
  <ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux> are good for Linux/Alpha, too.

  If you want to build your own kernel you may want to follow this
  <http://www.bart.nl/~geerten/patches.txt> recipe, by Harvey J. Stein.
  It's for 2.0.30: clean patches for 2.0.32 are available as well, and
  these can be used for 2.0.33 too.


  Patches for more recent 2.0 kernels (up to 2.0.35) are available from
  gatekeeper <ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/>.  A set for
  2.0.36 will appear as soon as Jay Estabrook finds the time to create
  them. Some people report some success by using the 2.0.35 patches on a
  2.0.36 kernel.

  Recent 2.1.xxx kernels will compile on Alpha without patches.  For
  kernels up to 2.1.131, do not forget to comment out "SMP = 1" in the
  Makefile (unless you are compiling for an SMP-system..)  In 2.1.132
  SMP has been changed into a normal config option.  With the system-
  type selections they also include a 'generic' option, to create a
  kernel that will run on any supported Alpha platform.

  Likewise for 2.2.0 and 2.2.1 (2.2.* is just the continuation of 2.1.*,
  now declared stable.) Beware of 2.2.2. though: it needs additional
  patches to compile on non-Intel platforms.

        More and better sound-card support compared to what comes with
        the Linux kernel.  Available from 4Front Technologies
        <http://www.4front-tech.com/oss.html>.  Also don't forget to
        check out Alsa <http://www.alsa-project.org>, the Advanced Linux
        Sound Architecture. They now have several Alpha machines and are
        ensuring that the next generation of Linux sound support runs on
        Alpha.


     XXVVSSccaann
        XVScan is, you guessed it, scanning software to use with John
        Bradley's _x_v. It supports "Most HP Scanjets, including the
        ancient ScanJet Plus..". Check out tummy.com,   ltd.
        <http://www.tummy.com/xvscan>. (Thanks to Michael Champigny for
        pointing this out.)

        Picture Elements <http://www.picturel.com>'s PCI image
        processing boards are actively supported under Linux/alpha. They
        also distribute some free software
        <http://www.picturel.com/software.html>, including tools/patches
        that will help you crosscompile from Linux/Alpha for a variety
        of other platforms.



     MMuullttiimmeeddiiaa ssooffttwwaarree
        A variety of Multimedia software is available from MpegTV

  Also be sure to read through the AlphaLinux.Org Software
  <http://www.alphalinux.org/software> pages for more commercial and
  non-commercial software.
  Aside from the above native applications many Linux/x86 applications
  can be run under Linux/Alpha using the em86 emulator.  See Section
  ``'' for details.

  There are basically three ways of getting Linux/Alpha booted,
  depending on what firmware you're using.  The preferred method of
  booting used to be to install MILO into the flash ROM. However, since
  all development on AlphaBIOS has stopped and there are only a few
  people left working on MILO, the preferred way is now via SRM console.


  Installation of and booting with MILO is described in the the MILO
  Howto <http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/milo.html>.  Be sure to use a
  recent MILO!  Booting with SRM is described in the SRM Howto
  <http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/srm.html>.



  1166..  EEMM8866:: HHooww TToo RRuunn LLiinnuuxx//xx8866 AAppppss oonn LLiinnuuxx//AAllpphhaa

  Thanks to Jim Paradis, it is now possible to run Linux/x86 binaries on
  your Alpha box. The em86 emulator is based on the FX!32
  emulator/binary translator Digital produced for Windows NT.
  (Unfortunately the second part is _n_o_t available for Linux.)


  The emulator is currently considered beta-quality, but it works very
  well for applications such as Netscape or Applix.  At present, a UDB
  may not be fast enough for em86 (depending on your patience, of
  course) but anything starting at a 300MHz 21164 should do nicely.  (If
  you are not satisfied with the speed, but happen to own a Digital Unix
  license for your machine, you may want to take a look at the next
  chapter.)
  A future version of em86 may include the ability to redirect shared-
  library calls to the native libs, rather than load the x86 versions
  which must be run through the emulator. This will not only improve the
  speed, but also save you a lot of discspace.


  See the em86 ftp directory <ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Linux-
  Alpha/em86/> for details. The README file will provide you with all
  the info you need to install the emulator. Note that for kernel
  version 2.0.30 the em86-patches are included in the alpha-patches
  <ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/Kernels/> at gatekeeper,
  which may save you some work.

  Here is what you can do with em86..












          Application Notes

                EM86 has been tested on numerous test cases and small
                applications (xtetris, for example). In addition, three
                major packages have been verified to run to varying
                degrees under EM86. Following are notes on each package.

                __________________________________________________________
                Application___________Notes_______________________________

                Netscape Navigator    Install Netscape Navigator Gold
                Gold 3.01             as per the supplied installation
                                      instructions.

                                      _____________ WARNING_____________

                                      DO NOT under ANY circumstances enable
                                      Java or JavaScript until further notice.
                                      Attempting to use these WILL crash your
                                      browser. While this is a known problem
                                      even under Linux/x86, none of the suggested
                                      workarounds improved the situation. We are
                                      currently investigating this problem.

                                      If Netscape has trouble locating
                                      Internet hosts, but you can ping
                                      these hosts from the command line,
                                      try installing an /etc/nsswitch.conf
                                      file.


                Adobe Acrobat Reader  Use the supplied install procedure
                3.0                   to install Acrobat Reader. With
                                      the em86-patch applied to your
                                      kernel, this application should
                                      run normally. Otherwise, you will
                                      need to modify the script

                                      /usr/local/Acrobat3/bin/acroread

                                      to use EM86 to invoke the acroread
                                      binary.

                Applixware 4.2        Because Applixware uses rpm for
                                      installation, you must override
                                      the architecture check. (rpm does
                                      not normally allow you to install
                                      the binaries for one architecture
                                      onto a machine of a different
                                      architecture). To override, copy
                                      the install script from the CD to
                                      a writable location, then edit the
                                      script to supply the "-ignorearch"
                                      flag to rpm. Since Applixware has
                                      binaries that invoke other binaries,
                                      you need to apply the em86-patch
                                      to the kernel for it to run. Since
                                      Applixware pushes lots of data on
                                      the stack, you also need to apply
                                      the traparg patch to the kernel.





  ..and here is what you cannot..



               Restrictions

                     The EM86 restrictions are as follows:

                     o   EM86 emulates user-mode code only.

                     o   EM86 cannot run programs that access virtual memory
                         above the address 78000000.

                     o   EM86 does not now, nor will in the future, support the
                         following system calls: setup, break, ptrace, stty,
                         gtty, prof, acct, phys, lock, mpx, ulimit, profil,
                         ioperm, iopl, idle, mx86, modify-Ldt, create_module,
                         init_module, delete_module, get_kernel_syms, bdflush,
                         afs_syscall, and sysctl.

                     o   EM86 0.9.1 does not support the following system
                         calls that will be supported in future releases: mount,
                         umount, uselib, old_readdir, sysinfo, ipc sigreturn,
                         clone, adjtimex, quotactl, sysfs, flock, msync, mlock,
                         munlock, mlockall, munlockall, sched_setparam,
                         sched_getparam, sched_setscheduler, sched_getscheduler,
                         sched_yield, sched_get_priority_max, sched_get_priority_min,
                         sched_rr_get_interval, nanosleep, and mremap.





  And if you don't care to spend all those CPU cycles while your Alpha
  pretends to be an Intel CPU, then the next chapter shows you an other
  way to make many applications available.

  licenses.  Now that Netscape's sourcecode is available, we expect to
  see a native Linux/Alpha version in the near future. However porting
  to 64bit proved more difficult than expected. A fairly stable version
  of Mozilla is available for download from the AlphaLinux Homepage

  Support for running ECOFF (the OSF and DU version of a.out) binaries
  must have been built into the Linux/Alpha kernels.  In effect, this
  allows you to run with minimal difficulty a large variety of programs
  that were originally compiled on an OSF/1 or Digital Unix Alpha.

  There are two separate lists of requirements depending on if you have
  access to OSF/1 v3.x or Digital Unix 4.x (Editor's note: Digital
  renamed DEC OSF/1 to DEC Unix somewhere around release 3.2---it's the
  same OS, just different releases).

  For both OSF/1 3.x and Digital Unix 4.x you must complete the
  following.


  1. Get /sbin/loader from the Digital machine and place it in
     /sbin/loader on your Linux box.

  2. Create a directory on your Linux box for /usr/shlib


  3. Get the following libraries from the Digital box and place in the
     /usr/shlib directory on your Linux box

  +o  libXm.so

  +o  libXmu.so

  +o  libm.so

  +o  libX11.so

  +o  libXt.so

  +o  libdnet_stub.so

  +o  libc.so

  +o  libXext.so

     If you are going to use Digital Unix 4.0 libs/loader you must also
     get:


  +o  libSM.so

  +o  libICE.so



  4. Get the file /etc/svc.conf from the Digital box and place it in
     /etc/svc.conf on your Linux box.


  5. Download from ftp.netscape.com <ftp://ftp.netscape.com/> the
     OSF/Alpha version of navigator (e.g., get netscape-
     v301-export.alpha-dec-osf2.0.tar.gz from this
     <ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/navigator/3.01/unix/> directory).


  6. Install it


  7. Run it!!

  This procedure has been tested on a RedHat 4.0 and RedHat 4.1 box with
  kernel versions 2.0.27, 2.0.28 (for OSF/1 3.x) and 2.1.23 (for DU
  4.x).  It seems to be very stable when running the OSF/1 libs/loader
  but I've noticed some problems with Segmentation Faults using the DU
  4.0 libs/loader.  I've also noticed that when using DU 4.0 libs/loader
  that the /etc/svc.conf file is not as necessary as when running the
  OSF/1 stuff.  It does complain, but it is not fatal.

  After setting Netscape up like this, sending E-Mail still fails. Oleg
  Gusev came up with the following solution:

  +o  mkdir /etc/sia/

  +o  touch /etc/sia/siainitgood

  +o  copy /etc/sia/matrix.conf from DU to Linux

  There can also be problems with using Netscape mail as a POP3 or IMAP
  client as a non-root user authenticated via NIS (no local account).
  Netscape complains that no user name has been specified even though
  one has been entered.
