><P
> You build MILO 
seperately from the Kernel.  As MILO requires parts of the kernel
to function (for example interrupt handling) you must first 
configure and build the
kernel that matches with MILO that you want to build.  Mostly this
means building the kernel with the same version number.  
So, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>MILO-2.0.25.tar.gz</TT
> will build against 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>linux-2.0.25.tar.gz</TT
>.
MILO <VAR
CLASS="LITERAL"
>may</VAR
> build against a higher version of the kernel, but there 
again it may not.
Also, now that ELF shared libraries are fully supported, there are two
versions of the MILO sources.
To build under an ELF system you must first unpack the standard MILO sources
and then patch those sources with the same version numbered ELF patch.
In the remainder of this discussion,
I assume that your kernel sources and object files are stored in the
subtree at <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/src/linux</TT
> and that the linux kernel has
been fully
built with the command <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make boot</B

change your working directory to the MILO source directory and

If you can (and want to), then type "y", otherwise "n".  
All of the standard, pre-built, MILO images include serial port I/O using COM1.</P

alternative BIOS emulation will be built.  It's sources are included
with MILO.
Note that you cannot right now build choose Digital's BIOS emulation code in
an ELF system (the library is not yet ready) and so you must answer no to this
question.</P
