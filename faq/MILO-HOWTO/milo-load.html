>The most commonly supported method of loading MILO is from the 
<SPAN

ARC firmware as most shipping systems support this.  However, there are
a wide variety of  loading MILO.   It may be loaded from:

       ARC firmware</A
></H2
><P
>Most, if not all, Alpha AXP based systems include the 
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Windows NT</SPAN
>
ARC firmware and this is the prefered method of booting MILO and thus
Linux.  Once the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Windows NT</SPAN
> firmware is running
and you have the correct
MILO image for your system, this method is completely generic.</P
><P
>The <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Windows NT</SPAN
> ARC firmware is an environment in
which programs can run and make callbacks into the firmware to perform actions.
The <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Windows NT</SPAN
>
OSLoader is a program that does exactly this.   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Linload.exe</TT
>
is a 
much simpler program which does just enough to load and execute MILO.
It loads the appropriate image
file into memory at 0x00000000 and then makes a swap-PAL PALcall to
it.  
MILO, like Linux, uses a different PALcode to 
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Windows NT</SPAN
> which is why the
swap has to happen.
MILO relocates itself to 0x200000 and continues on through the
PALcode reset entry point as before.</P
><P
>Before you add a Linux boot option, 
you will need to copy <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>linload.exe</TT
> and the appropriate
MILO that you wish to load to someplace that the 
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Windows NT</SPAN
> ARC firmware can read from.  
In the following example, I assume that you are booting from a DOS format floppy
disk:</P

byte block.   To load MILO via the SRM you must generate that structure on a
