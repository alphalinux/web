<H2><A NAME="Supported Systems"></A> <A NAME="s5">5. What Systems Does Linux/Alpha Run On?</A></H2>

<P> The number of Alpha platforms that are supported by Linux is
quickly increasing. The following is a list of workstations and
motherboards that are known to work with Linux.
If you have any corrections to the list, please send 
<A HREF="mailto:docs@alphalinux.org">us</A> mail.
More information on these system types is also available at
the 
<A HREF="http://www.alphalinux.org/docs">AlphaLinux.org documentation archives</A>.

<A HREF="http://www.compaq.com/alphaserver/es40/index.html">ES40</A></B> The ES40 is
currently one of the largest Alpha machines that runs Linux. It's available with 1-4 500MHz CPUs with
4MB of cache or 1-4 667MHz CPUs with 8MB of DDR cache, and supports up to 32Gig of memory.
Linux kernels for these machines should be compiled as either Generic or DP264.

<A HREF="http://www.compaq.com/alphaserver/ds10/index.html">DS10</A> 
<A HREF="       http://www5.compaq.com/alphaserver/ds10l/index.html">DS10L</A></B> The difference between the
DS10 and the DS10L is that the L version is a 1U rack-mountable unit, whereas the standard DS10 is
a desktop box. These are based on the Tsunami chipset and have CPUs at either 466 or 600MHz, with
2MB of cache.
Linux kernels for these machines should be compiled as either Generic or DP264.

</LI>
<LI> <P><B>
<A HREF="http://www.digital.com/alphaserver/workstations/">XP1000 and XP900</A></B> These
are the last true workstation products to come out of Digital/Compaq. From now on all the workstations
will use the same parts as the servers. The XP1000 is sold with either a 500MHz (Monet) or
667MHz (Brisbane) CPU and both are based on the Tsunami chipset.. The XP900 is sold as a VMS workstation.
Linux kernels for these machines should be compiled as either Generic or DP264.

<A HREF="http://www.api-networks.com/products/up1000-board.shtml">UP1000</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.api-networks.com/products/up1100-board.shtml">UP1100</A></B> Products
of Alpha Processor Inc (now API NetWorks Inc). Both are based around the AMD Irongate system
controller and can take up 768MB of memory (3slots, PC100 Unbuffered ECC 168Pin DIMMs). The UP1000
uses API's slot B and can accommodate either a 600MHz 2MB or 700MHz 4MB slotB. The UP1100 has a 600MHz
processor soldered to the board and a 2MB cache (all the CPUs uses in both boards are EV67). 
The UP1100 also has UDMA66 support (UP1000 has
UDMA33), onboard sound (use the trident driver is 2.2.16 or later) and an onboard 21143 (tulip) ethernet
controller. Both boards also have dual serial, parallel and dual USB (yes, the USB does work under Linux).
Linux kernels for these machines should be compiled as either Generic or Nautilus.
<P>
</LI>
<LI> <P><B>
<A HREF="http://www.api-networks.com/products/up2000-board.shtml">UP2000 and UP2000+</A></B> Another product of Alpha Processor Inc, now API NetWorks Inc. They are very similar
to the DP264 series except that they can only take 2Gig of RAM (8 Slots, uses PC100 Registered ECC
168Pim DIMMs) and have a different SCSI controller (Adaptec Ultra2Wide). Instead of using the
daugthercard approach that the DP264 uses, the UP2000 and UP2000+ use the API SlotB which contains
the processor, cache and VRM. SlotBs for these boards are available in the following configs:
600MHz 2MB, 667MHz 2MB, 667MHz 4MB, 750MHz 4MB, 750MHz 8MB and 833MHz 4MB (DDR cache, UP2000+ only).
Linux kernels for these machines should be compiled as either Generic or DP264.

<A HREF="http://www.api-networks.com/products/264dp-board.shtml">DP264</A> and
<A HREF="http://www5.compaq.com/alphaserver/ds20e/index.html">DS20/DS20E</A></B> The DP264
and DS20 are dual EV6 (or EV67) machines based on Tsunami. The DP264 is the OEM version and
is almost functionally the same. They support up to 4Gig of memory using PC100 Registered
ECC 200 Pin DIMMs with 16 slots. They also have onboard Adaptec SCSI (Ultra Wide) and support
speeds of 500 or 667 (500s have either 2 or 4MB or cache, 667 has either 4MB (Samsung) or
8MB of DDR cache (Compaq)).
Linux kernels for these machines should be compiled as either Generic or DP264.

<A HREF="http://www.api-networks.com/products/164ux-board.shtml">AlphaPC 164UX</A></B> Interestingly,
this is not a Digital product. It was developed by Deskstation,
(called RUFFIAN then), and is now being sold by Samsung. It supports
speeds up to 800 MHz, and comes with on-board Ultra Wide SCSI
(Symbios Logic 53C875), and 10/100 Mb Ethernet (Digital 21143).
Like the 164SX an LX, it uses DIMMs (SDRAM) for memory, but
it has 6 slots rather then 4.
<P>
</LI>
<LI> <P><B>
<A HREF="http://www.dec.com/semiconductor/alpha/dsc-pc164lx.html">AlphaPC 164LX</A></B> is Digital's best bet. It's based on the
<B>AlphaPC 164</B>, but with speeds up to 600 MHz, and using
DIMMs rather than SIMMs. (i.e. SDRAM rather then DRAM.)
<P>
</LI>
<LI> <P>The low end of the EV5  generation is the <B>
<A HREF="http://www.digital.com/semiconductor/alpha/dsc-pc164sx.html">AlphaPC 164SX</A></B>. It uses the 21164PC variant of the
Alpha microprocessor, at 400 or 533 MHz. This board is targeted
at the NT Workstation market, but it will run Linux just fine.
<P>
</LI>
<LI> <P>For a complete Workstation you may want to look at <B>Miata</B> (Personal Workstation). This comes with a Graphics
Card (Powerstorm) for which X11 support does not (yet) exist,
but Matrox Millennium is a popular replacement.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>  <P><B>Alcor (AS600), Bret (AS500)</B>.  The Alcor kernel
is supposed to work fine with the AlphaStation 500 as
well.  If you can confirm this, please let us know.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>  <P><B>EB164</B>.  The Aspen Timberline and Summit machines are
similar to this machine/motherboard.  The EB164 has been replaced
by the PC164 and it's successors (see above).
<P>
</LI>
<LI> <P><B>Cabriolet (aka AlphaPC64):</B>
This is a PCI-bus based motherboards using the 21064 Alpha CPU.  
It is more pricey than the 21066 systems but it does make for a
real nice system and many third-party products are based on this
design.  This board typically runs at 275MHz but some vendors sell
an (overclocked) 300MHz version. It really is historical now, but
you may be able to find them at very attractive prices.
<P>
</LI>
<LI> <P><B>Mikasa</B> (AlphaServer 1000).  Noritake (AlphaServer 1000a)
is supported as well, if you use kernels 2.0.30 or higher, with the
appropriate patches. However, the builtin Cirrus graphics card
is not (or very poorly) supported by X11.
<P>
</LI>
<LI> <P><B>Mustang (AS200),M3 (AS250),(AS255),Avanti (AS400)
:</B> Linux now runs on all of these AlphaStations.
The reason for clumping all these machines together is that they are
all very similar to program.  In particular, they all can run one
and the same kernel when booted using the same firmware.  Thus,
when configuring a kernel, simply pick "Avanti" as the system type
since that covers all of the above machines.
<P>
</LI>
<LI> <P><B>XL</B>
The XL machine is also know as the "Windows NT Dream Machine."
Well, for what it's worth, (most of them) are perfectly happy
running Linux.
<P>The regular XL is based on the 21064 CPU and runs either at 233
or 266MHz with 512KB or 2MB of second level cache, respectively.
<P>The newer 
<A HREF="http://www.digital.com/info/CU3102/">XL Turbo</A>
is based on the 21164A CPU and runs either at
300 or 366MHz.  The Turbo always comes with 2MB of
second-level cache.
<P>
</LI>
<LI> <P><B>ALPHAbook 1</B>
The ALPHAbook 1 is a 21066A based notebook (the first and only
portable Alpha, so far).  Linux works fine on this machine with
a few extra patches.  An X server is available for this machine
as well.
<P>
</LI>
<LI> <P><B>
<A HREF="http://www.alphalinux.org/docs/jensen.shtml">Jensen</A> (aka DEC 2000 aka DECpc AXP 150):</B>
This is the oldest of all Alpha PCs and comes with an EISA bus.
You probably don't want to buy such a machine new anymore since
you can now get faster machines for less money.  However, it is
not uncommon to get really amazing deals for these machines and
a Jensen definitively would make a nice home box.  The
firmware seems a little picky about what graphics card and SCSI
controllers
it wants, but if you're just looking for an affordable Alpha box,
it might be worthwhile to look into it.
<P>
</LI>
<LI> <P><B>Noname (aka AXPpci33):</B>
This is a PCI-bus based motherboard using the 21066 Alpha CPU
(Low-Cost Alpha).  The core of the 21066 is the same as the 21064.
The only difference is that the 21066 also has a memory and I/O
controller integrated into the chip (which has the effect that the
external interface is much simpler and therefore much cheaper).
This board is available in a 166 and a 233MHz version.
<P>
</LI>
<LI> <P><B>
<A HREF="http://www.alphalinux.org/docs/udb-multia.shtml">UDB</A>:</B>
Linux/Alpha also runs well on the Universal Desktop Box.
(That's the box that's called "Multia" when it's running Windows NT.)
The TGA graphics card and the builtin soundcard
are supported.  The UDB is basically a Noname board with more
hardware builtin and wrapped into a neat little box.  So when
configuring a kernel for it, simply select the "Noname" system
type.  The UDB currently provides the lowest-cost entry point
into the Alpha world.
<P>
</LI>
<LI> <P><B>EB*:</B>
Digital used to sell various other evaluation boards (e.g.,
EB66, EB64+, etc.). Reportedly, Linux/Alpha may run on some of
these.  But they were relatively pricey and should now be
considered obsolete.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Unsupported Systems</A>
</H2>

<P> Linux/Alpha is unlikely to support the TURBOchannel-based Alpha
systems in the near (or any) future (this is the DEC 3000 series of
workstations).  The reason for this is two-fold: first, these machines
have an I/O system that is very different from PCI-based machines and
therefore do not look anything like PCs (e.g., pretty much all drivers
would have to be written from scratch).  Second, with the advent of
PCI, the TURBOchannel is pretty much dead technology (for better or
worse) and it just isn't all that much fun to develop software for
dead technology (on the other hand, it may soon be possible to buy
such systems cheaply, which would make them more interesting to Linux
users, I suppose).
<P>If you have such a machine and want to run a free OS, look for the
*BSD's. At least one of them supports the 3000 series.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Table</A>
</H2>

<P>The table below (one of Jay Estabrook's many invaluable contributions)
may prove useful to select the right MILO/Kernel/bootfloppy for your
system.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
The following table may be useful; sorry, but I haven't put in the "family" designations
explicitly, but the groupings and MILOs are indicative, mostly.
