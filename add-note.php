Just add your comment in the big field below, and, optionally, your email 
address in the little one (usual anti-spam practices are OK, e.g.
johnNOSPAM@doe.NO_SPAM.com).</p>

<p>Note that HTML tags are not allowed in the posts, but the note is presented
inside a &lt;pre&gt; element so formatting is preserved. URLs will be turned
into clickable links automatically. <i>(Double-check that your note appears as you
want during the preview. That's why it is there!)</i></p>

<p>Please read the following points carefully before submitting your comment. 
If your post falls into one of the categories mentioned there, it will be 
rejected by one of the editors.</p>

<ul>
<li> If you are trying to <A href="http://bugs.php.net/">report a
bug</A>, or <a href="http://bugs.php.net/">request a new feature or language
change</a> you're in the wrong place.</li>

<li> If you are just commenting on the fact that something is not documented, 
save your breath. This is where <b>you</b> add to the documentation, not where 
you ask <b>us</b> to add the documentation. You may choose to email the 
<a href="mailto:phpdoc@lists.php.net"> PHP Documentation Team</a> to discuss 
the change.</li>

<li>This is also not the correct place to <a href="/support.php">ask questions</a> 
(even if you see others have done that before, we are editing the notes slowly 
but surely). If you need support send email to the <a href="mailto:php-general@lists.php.net">
php-general list</a>.</li>

</ul>

<h3>If you post a note in any of the categories above, it will edited and/or removed.</h3>

<p>
Just to make the point once more. The notes are being edited and support
questions/bug reports/feature request/comments on lack of documentation, are
being <b>deleted</b> from them (and you may get a <b>rejection</b> email), so
if you post a question/bug/feature/complaint, it will be removed. (But once you
get an answer/bug solution/function documentation, feel free to come back
and add it here!)</p>
<p>(And if you're posting an example of validating email addresses, please
don't bother. Your example is almost certainly wrong for some small subset of
cases. See <a href="http://examples.oreilly.com/regex/">this information from
O'Reilly Mastering Regular Expressions book</a> for the gory details.)</p>
