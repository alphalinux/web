Hi,

I would like to know what files are included in the package with an
extension of ".deb". After I install such a package, where do those files
go? I mean, how can I get a list of the pathes of those installed files? I
know there is an option "- qpil" for rpm which will print out the files
with their locations. I am looking for a similar one for Debian.

Thanks for your help. 

Qin

Hi all,

Are there limitations on what king of framebuffer can be useds on Alphas ...
in particular can I use my Voodoo3 3000 in my AS 1000A?

Cheers
Iain

Once installed, you can do this (example is for binutils, but substitute
package name that you want to know about):
	dpkg -L binutils
And it will print out all of the files that were installed by the package 
and their locations.  It will also mention any diversions made by the
package. If the package is not installed, do this:
	dpkg -c binutils_2.10.0.24-2.deb

You may want to pipe the output through a pager, though, since it can be
lengthy for some packages.

Any time :-)

King of framebuffers?  Wish I had one of those!

All joking aside, there are only a few "framebuffer" drivers that work on
Alpha (that is, using the framebuffer device driver).  I just quickly
looked in the kernel docs and the only ones that I could find listed are
the Matrox and TGA framebuffer drivers (the docs may be outdated, though).

HOWEVER, this does NOT preclude you from using that card in an Alpha.  In
fact, most Voodoo3 cards are known to work in Alphas (I haven't heard of
one that doesn't yet), although we don't have an X server for them
yet in the stable tree of Debian.  You could compile one, however, if
you're so inclined to install XFree86 4.0.x.

King of Framebuffers ........ I wish (-:

Last night I tried to install an other brand of linux (shall remain nameless
but there is a "hat" involved) because I have had problems getting hold of
potato for alpha. I assume that my problems are generic rather than with the
"hatted" brand.

When booting the AlphaServer 1000A from SRM with a CD the GUI install the
screen goes blank as it the VGA card is not supported. After replacing the
VGA card with a more generic Cirrus card all went well ... almost (a story
for another day). The screen went blank also when booting with the Voodoo3.

I have heard it rumoured that Alphas have problems with fancy video cards
.... is this true? Should I just go back to Potato for Sparc? Are Alpha's
too much hassle?

Cheers
Iain

Not necessarily. The Debian installer is by far the best installer for an
alpha distro that I have seen. The others seems to be strait ports of
Intel-platform installers.

Could be any number of problems. Did you play around with the video settings
by passing various arguments to the kernel?

They're definately not too much hassle. But it depends what you want to do
with your machines; if you want top processor performance and a fully 64-bit

Slightly off-topic...

The Voodoo3 does not work on a Ruffian (UX) board. (No 
signal.) At least, not on mine---then again, neither does 
much of anything else. I wish I'd never bought it, 
considering that it uses the exceedingly shitty ARCSBIOS, 
which has cost me days of work trying to work around its 
limitations, not to mention months of downtime trying to 
get it replaced and working again after it broke (still 
waiting, but there's light at the end of the tunnel).

OK, Debian it is, just having problems getting hold of potato at the moment.

Nothing was passed to the kernel on boot.

I would like to hope that they are not too much hassle. I have a SparcUltra

be a bit faster that the sparc (-:

Not necessarily. The Debian installer is by far the best installer for an
alpha distro that I have seen. The others seems to be strait ports of
Intel-platform installers.

Could be any number of problems. Did you play around with the video settings
by passing various arguments to the kernel?

They're definately not too much hassle. But it depends what you want to do
with your machines; if you want top processor performance and a fully 64-bit
userland, Alpha is the only choice. (Unless the 64-bit SPARC userland
project
is further along than I thought?)

Yes Alphas (actually it's the firmware) has problems with some video
cards that do "fancy" x86 BIOS calls. A work around to this would be to
install from the serial console. Linux should be fine with the card
(AFAIK) and if you get a newer X then what is in potato (maybe one from
woody?) then you should be all set. IIRC you don't need the firmware to
init the video as Linux does something on it's own...=20

No Alphas are actually quite nice and unless I have been living under a
rock for a while (possible!) I think we are much further along with
Linux on Alpha then SPARC is.=20

did you try the "hatted" brand in text mode?

well, FWIW I've had mixed luck with Voodoo3 cards and X 3.3.6. In some
machine they work fine, others seem to have problems. 4.0 looks to be much
better in this respect.

Alphas can be difficult at times, however once you're over the hurdles I
find them much easier to deal with. As for video cards, the only cards
that have a real problem are the NVIDIA TNT2 based cards...they use
extended bios calls that the x86 emulator in the Alphas doesn't
understand, but if you get to SRM/AlphaBIOS/ARCBios then things are
looking good.

It should be better than that; I went through 2.2.17-pre and
2.4.0-test6-pre and fixed a few small problems that made some of the
others work as well; Rage128 was one that I fixed, along with
Permedia2. More are available under 2.4.x, including nVidia and 3Dfx
which worked OOTB on Alpha, but a number were not checked or didn't
work - Cirrus, SiS, Mach64.

I believe there was working support for 3Dfx in 3.3.6, though it
wasn't built by default on Alpha even though it did work.

But, it sounded as if the 1000A SRM console did work OK with the
Voodoo3, which is the first hurdle that must be cleared. Whether
it would work with others, such as nVidia or the like, is unclear;
it must be tried to find out. Using the latest SRM console available
for the 1000A is the best bet, but I'm almost certain (at least) the
later nVidia cards would not work, as the BIOS emulator only recently
(on the EV6 platforms at least) became able to run their code... :-\

Jay,

	The BIOS emulator has been updated to support these
instructions? Do you know which SRM rev it's bundled with (5.7, 5.8 ?). As
I'm pretty sure 5.6 doesn't work.

--rdp (coming very close to taking the Diamond V770 out of his PC to try
in the Alpha).

This is very good news!  Thank you for clarifying that.  The docs I found
were pretty antiquated.

Did it?  I'm still running an ancient S3 card in mine, so I didn't know
whether or not to recommend enabling it for Alpha for Debian.  I seemed to
recall some issues with it, but that could've been with a prior X release.

Yeah, I noted that SRM seemed ok with with it, which puts the kernel in
focus as the next "let's see if this is the problem" step of diagnosing
their situation.

Not sure about this one.  Have you tried the last beta firmware upgrade?

I couldn't get a V3 or an ATI Xpert@Play to work in my Ruffian. It's
the nasty ARCSBIOS, and Samsung/API haven't updated it in 2 years
or so..

The ATI works fine in the PWS I have..

Unfortunatly the UX is the odd man out....it was designed by DeskStation
and has its own firmware (ARCSBios...no SRM, no AlphaBIOS, no
ARCBios). I think the latest firmware is on the API site, but it's a year
or so old.

AFAIK, you shouldn't need to pass anything special to the kernel for it to
work.

I'll take that sparc if you don't want it :-P  (I've got three older
sparcs already).

Question on your problem, though...once it gets past SRM, is there ANY
text echoed to the screen (ie. kernel messages) or is it just blank?  I'm
wondering if it's the kernel at fault or if it's something else.  If the
kernel text is showing, then that's one more thing we can probably
eliminate.  Also, if it's DarkHelmet...er...RedHat, then I believe they
run the vga16 server for part of their install (please correct me if I'm
wrong...it's been awhile since I played with RH), which may also have
some problem dealing with the V3.

There's a UX bios update (v1.3.062) on API's site that has a timestamp of
8 Sep 99.  It's old (maybe too old), but it may be newer than what you're
using.  I have no idea what changed, though.

That's good news at least :-P

If I remember correctly the last updates were mainly Y2K, I don't think
the emulator was ever updated/changed.

Hi,

Does booting debian from SRM only works with a certain SCSI controllers? 

I've got an LX164 with a buslogic scsi controller and I use AlphaBIOS / MILO
at the moment. I wonder if it's possible to boot from the harddisk using
SRM/aboot with this system? (when changed AlphaBIOS to SRM, I couldn't see
my harddisk using show dev, so I
changed back to AlphaBIOS).


Cheers,

Raoul.

Ah, ok...that's too bad, then.  Ugh.  Yeah, I understand that the UX is
the odd man, though.  It's a shame that it wasn't kept up with by another
party (not meaning you guys, just saying SOMEONE else).

Depends on which controller and the SRM support of same for the
motherboard you have.  I have an SX and I recently switched to SRM from
AlphaBIOS.  I use a Tekram 390F (Symbios 53c875) and have had no problems
booting from either of my hard drives.

Hmmm...Jay would probably be the best person to ask this from, since he
usually knows what's supported in the SRM versions.  Which BusLogic card
is it and which SRM version did you try?

I believe v5.7 (or later) SRM will work - I had a TNT2 in a DS10 and it
worked fine.

Yup :) Oh this is good news......we now have a UP2000 with a TNT2 card in
there, happily sitting at the SRM prompt.

I installed DS20 5.8-10 SRM in a UP2000 and my PCI nvidia tnt2 DOES come up.
I'm compiling the latest Xfree as I type....

I think the HCLs are the definitive (externally accessible :-) source.

We've tended to stick with controller families (so that updating a
driver was all that was needed) rather than introducing completely new
ones.  Recent additions have been Adaptec (but not all of them), Intel
EEPro100 NIC, NCR/Symbios 896, and a couple of recent Mylex RAID
controllers. Those are only the ones I know of, ie there may be
others.

Yes, it can and does vary by platform, and by age as well. EV6
platforms don't have code to support the original TGA or the old MYLEX
RAID controllers, for example. Certain options are "retired" from the
actively developed platforms due to age, and new ones added there and
rarely backported. For example, SRM v5.7 for the EV6s added support
for some Adaptec SCSI controllers. Fortunately, that code was
backported into the LX and SX SRM consoles, but I don't know of any
other pre-EV6 platforms in which this happened, or is likely to
happen.

It would be *very* nice to have such a list...

Thanks for clearing that up :-)  I was wondering about if BusLogic was
supported myself (wow, am I glad I didn't buy that other card I was
looking at when I bought the 390F).  Is there any way that we can get a
list of SRM-supported stuff or should we just rely on the HCL's on
Compaq's site?

Hmm...the only problem is that it can/might vary by platform type. We
could certainly set something up as to which cards we know to work on a
given platform.

Would that help?

OK, I'll see if I can put together a PHP/MsySQL app at alphalinux.org so
that we can enter this info (something else to do in my copious spare

Most definitely!  Any list is better than none.  I'd be happy to repost it

Thank you so much!  I know what you mean by spare time.  Mine is now
consumed by writing a PHP/MySQL app to catalog my DVD's using the now
infamous cuecat barcode scanner :-P  I'm not releasing it to prevent any
C&D letters from Digital Convergence :-P (as the corporations like to say,
I'm writing it "for internal use only") :-P

Depends not only on the manufacturer (BusLogic is NOT supported), but also
the specific chipset - NCR/Symbios 810/875/895 are fine, 860 was not.

SRM supports, in general, only the options which we (DEC/COMPAQ) have
sold to run under OSF1/DU/Tru64 or VMS. That some cards that we've not
sold will work, ie some of the SCSI NCR810/875/895 or QLogic or
(recently) Adaptec ones, or some of the third party TULIP NICs, is
luck... ;-}

But you're out of luck with BusLogic under SRM if you boot from it; if
you can boot another way (from a supported SCSI or IDE disk or over
the net) then you can stick with SRM, otherwise go back to AlphaBIOS
and MILO...

Good luck.

Hi!

I am install Debian Linux on my AS1000A 5/333 and
have some problems.

I am try to use 2.2.16 and 2.4.0 kernels.

With 2.2.16 kernel system normally shutdown,when i type "shutdown -h" or
"shutdown -r", but cannot out to SRM. It print:

halted CPU0
halt code = 5
HALT instruction executed
PC=fffffc0000310040

and start scrolling message :

System Machine Check Through
Vector 00000660 logout frame address 0x6060 code 0x211
IPRs:
EXC_ADDR=... etc ...


With 2.4.0 kernel system out to SRM, but cannot reboot.

SRM print:
(booting dka0 .......)
failed to open dka0.


Any ideas?



With MBR
Alexey


P.S. Sorry for my bad english ;)

How's this for a start? There's only info for 164sx and UP2000 at the
moment.

I wonder, if there is any information about *how* SRM determines, if a card is supported
or not. Does SRM just read the PCI config space and identify a card by it's 
vendor_id/device_id byte pairs, or is there more magic involved.

I have observed, that some cheap symbios-based SCSI cards, which simply *clone* the
config-space from symbios are supported by SRM, without obviously being an orginial
DEC/Compaq part. Others, with customized PROM's are not, using the same chip.
That leads me to the conclusion, that there is ( to some degree ) some involvement of
the PCI config space.

Is there some sort of "SRM internals guide" available ( still looking for some doc of the
SRM ccb's though... ) ?

Regards,
Thomas Weyergraf

Looks great!  I'll be adding to it once I reboot (need to boot a new
kernel, and I'll check my SRM rev then as well).

Thanks a ton!

Is this the stock installation kernel on the boot disks?  If so, it
shouldn't be 2.2.16, IIRC (should be 2.2.17pre-something).  Give the one
on the rescue disk a try and see if you get the same problem.

> With 2.4.0 kernel system out to SRM, but cannot reboot.

This isn't that surprising.  Several of my machines that I'm running
2.4.0-test kernels on die while trying to reboot (sparc, mips,
alpha).  The 2.4.0-test kernels are still far from being reliable on archs
other than i386, so caveat emptor.

> P.S. Sorry for my bad english ;)

No problem.  Wish my Russian was better (I only know a few phrases,
unfortunately) :-)

Hi,

I've got a major problem which I don't seem to find the solution to. I've
been running 2.1 for quite som time now (perfect stability, never went
down) and now it's time to move on, but I can't. I have a "noname" with an
old milo in flash, and it refuses to load any kernel newer than 2.0.36.

The newer 2.0 and 2.2 series of milo doesn't work from flash, and the old
milo cannot start ldmilo.exe, linload.exe, a newer milo nor the firmware
update utility (with SRM and ARC in it).

Can the firmware utility be put on a fail-safe disk, and if so, how? Any
hints would be very appreciated :)

/daniel

Ugh...precisely why I never flashed MILO on my nonames :-(  I'll look into
it as I seem to recall some way of restoring the original firmware, but
can't remember how or if it ended up being possible or not.

My first thought would be to have a look at the MILO-HOWTO in the System
Specific section
(http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/milo-5.html#ss5.6).  Perhaps you boot SRM
or ARC from a boot block floppy and restore the system to SRM/ARC after
getting one of the consoles to boot.

this is how I re-flashed mine recently when it went off and trashed itself.
there should be a jumper on the motherboard which says "boot off floppy" or
similar.

the following creates an srm bootable floppy, but I found that my system also boots
with the jumper set as above.  I do not know if this works on any other boards though.

HTH.

found at:
 http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/

 Bootable Floppy C - Boot Floppy (Digital UNIX systems)

     1. From the table below, download the appropriate firmware update image
	  from the alpha255 directory in the V5.7 CD area
    Rename the downloaded file to fwupdate.exe.
    2. Download the file mkbootfirm.tar from the utilities directory in the
		top level of the    firmware area. You can untar mkbootfirm on a Digital
		UNIX system with the command:
       tar xvf mkbootfirm.tar
found at:
http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/readmes/utilities/mkbootfirm.tar

    3. Make sure you have a floppy that has been low-level formatted.
       For example, to low-level format a floppy in drive zero:
       fddisk -fmt /dev/rfd0a
    4. Run mkbootfirm on the .exe firmware image that you downloaded.
       mkbootfirm uses a .exe firmware image to create a file that can be dd'd
		to a floppy.
       Enter the following command to create a bootable floppy from a
		downloaded .exe firmware
       image:
       ./mkbootfirm fwupdate.exe | dd of=/dev/rfd0c bs=64k
       NOTE: This assumes the mkbootfirm executable is in the current
		directory and that the
       floppy is in drive zero.
    5. Insert the floppy on the target system and boot it from the SRM
		console:
       P00>>> boot dva0

   For more detailed instructions, please refer to the release notes.

Hi,

sorry for the off-topic post, but are my postings visible to others ?
I have submitted some postings here over the last weeks, but received no reply.

I wonder, if their contents was just not interesting, or if they have not been seen
on this list ;-(

A short reply would be suffice.

Thanks a lot.

Regards,
Thomas Weyergraf

I've gotten three of them (this one included) over the past week or two,
one of which I believe that I replied to.  I'm still trying to get around
to working on the kernel patch.  Given the mood of the kernel list this
past week, it's taking me a lot to get in the right frame of mind to work
on or submit a patch.

I know I saw them and at least they were interesting to me :-)  Some I
just didn't have answers to at the time, though.

Progress at last.

I installed DarkHelmet in text mode an all went well. However when the
machine reboots and when I point to the boot device I get error messages and
it refused to boot ..... bad block device etc ..... I have checked the
syntax a million times and I am convinced it is ok.

Anyone any thoughts? 

I'm becoming rather upset with Alphas ...... it only took me 2 days to
master linux on Sparcs.

Cheers
Iain

AFAIK, you shouldn't need to pass anything special to the kernel for it to
work.

I'll take that sparc if you don't want it :-P  (I've got three older
sparcs already).

Question on your problem, though...once it gets past SRM, is there ANY
text echoed to the screen (ie. kernel messages) or is it just blank?  I'm
wondering if it's the kernel at fault or if it's something else.  If the
kernel text is showing, then that's one more thing we can probably
eliminate.  Also, if it's DarkHelmet...er...RedHat, then I believe they
run the vga16 server for part of their install (please correct me if I'm
wrong...it's been awhile since I played with RH), which may also have
some problem dealing with the V3.

Can you give us the exact message from SRM?

Also, when you partitioned the disks, did you use BSD disklabels? If I
remember correctly, DarkHelmet will not change an existing DOS disklabel
to BSD, but if the disk is clean it will write a BSD label. SRM needs a
BSD disklabel to boot.

There's more info in the SRM Howto:

Rich, I followed you faq to the letter. I used fdisk to create the
partitions.

Unfortunately I am at work so I will have to wait until I get home )-:

Can you give us the exact message from SRM?

Also, when you partitioned the disks, did you use BSD disklabels? If I
remember correctly, DarkHelmet will not change an existing DOS disklabel
to BSD, but if the disk is clean it will write a BSD label. SRM needs a
BSD disklabel to boot.

There's more info in the SRM Howto:

Has anyone got potato to successfully install on a PC164-based system?

I've got one, @500 MHz with symbios (538XX) and adaptec (3944UWD) SCSI
boards, a 3C905B NIC, and a Millennium II 16MB video card.

The kernel appears to hang right after scanning the SCSI buses. At the
moment, there is nothing connected to either SCSI card, so they could come
out for experimental purposes. I also tried booting off the slink
floppies, again as an experiment; This time, the install proceeded all the
way to the point where I started to install base. Needless to say, I need
a stack of more reliable floppies.

Any ideas?

Thanks,

JDM

Hi Jason,

Did you use the right type (differential ! ) terminators on that
( neat !) adaptec 3944 (both channels ?)

There's a table of vendor/device ID pairs; nothing more...

Not that I know of; you could always search through the ROM looking
for the data... ;-}

Hi,

i am looking for the "21174 Core logic Chip technical reference manual" in an online
version ( Yes, today I got my 164lx ).
This manual should be something similar to the 21172 Version ( like PC164 ).

I tried the usual suspects, like ftp.digital.com/pub/Digital/info/semiconductor/literature/
but didn't find it.

Was it ever released there ? Anybody having a PDF/PS version ? Any other
pointers ?

>From the 164LX technical reference manual, I noticed some interesting differences between
21172 and 21174, which I would like to read more about. Also, I need it for 
my_little_home_project (TM) ;-)

Any ideas ?

Thanks a lot.

Regards,
Thomas Weyergraf

Arrgh. I thought, I got over the Prom-disassembly back in the early 80's, trying to
figure out what was going on in the CPM-Bios of various systems. 8-)

I wonder, if there are more, then those used in linux ( include/asm-alpha/console.h or
arc/alpha/lib/callback_srm.S ).

I believe it may be kept compressed in the ROM.  I tried to do this once
and ended up writing a small wrapper which would run the ROM code in
userland just to see what it decompresses itself into.  In fact, it is
much easier to take the code from the RAM on a working system, because SRM
(unlike more modest consoles like MILO) sits in memory uncompressed.

The console architecture (which is a more correct term than `SRM
internals') is described in the Alpha Architecture Reference Manual and is
only available in a printed form.  SRM is just an implementation of the
Alpha console (that's why console.h is a good file name and callback_srm.S
is not).  If you want, I can scan the ccb stuff and let you download it.

Yes, I have a copy that I keep locally, but you can find it on Compaq's
site at:
http://www.support.compaq.com/alpha-tools/documentation/current/chip-docs.html

Rich, can you add the above to ALO?  I noticed that it still has the old
link to the digital site (which is outdated).  Thanks!

I'll check to see if I updated the documentation link on the Debian Alpha
port page (think I did).  If not, I'll do that today.

Hehehehe...yeah, I need all of the chipset docs that I can find for the
GNUmach port, so I know the feeling of digging for docs.  If you can't
find something, let me know since I might have it already or at least know
where to find it.

The Digital link is still active and contains about the same stuff as the new
Compaq Link. Thanks anyway for that one, since I assume the Digital stuff will not be
there forever.

However, even the Compaq link does not carry the docs on the 21174. It only
shows 21172. No go in current or in the archives. Either I am stupid ( which is sometimes
a reasonable assumption ;-), or it's really not there. I checked Api Inc's website, but they
do not seem to carry any chipset docs at all :-(

Is there some obscure secret hidden in the 21174 ?

I checked, and it's not updated, but still points to the vaild digital site.

I hereby let you know :-).

Actually, no...let me see...I thought I had them SOMEWHERE....I'll dig
around....if I find something, I'll forward it to you (sorry, I thought
you were looking for the 21172 docs initially).

> I checked, and it's not updated, but still points to the vaild digital site.

Ok, I'll fix this in a few minutes.  The pages should be updated in a day
or two.

Thanks Brian..

With the addition of this you can now compile the tdfx-2-1-branch on
Alpha.

If you want to try the 64bit version of Glide3. Then you can check out
the
sources from the Glide project on SourceForge and use the branch
'Glide3-64bit'.

Thanks.

Alan.

Thanks, I would have done that if I had access to Tru64 or something like
that :) 
Anyway, thanks for all the mails I got with suggestions! I finally found
this lovely little program called srmbootfat and voila :)

Then I had to fight two more days to get my 3com nic (3c59x) working, with
2.0.x kernels it came up at IRQ 10, but with 2.2.x I had to physically
move the card to get different that IRQ (it doesn't work with 13 or 15).

Nonames seems strange when it comes to the hardware, can you (in linux)
tweak the memory speed settings the 21066 offers, or is it a waste of time
even thinking about it? It seems to love heavy overclocking :)

Now everything seems to work, so that I can go back to being a happy
Debian user. I hope it takes a really long time before woody gets stable :)

Thomas,

Check out Daniel Potts' web page for the L4/Alpha project.  He includes
links to a lot of Alpha documentation, including the 21174 TRM.

Nice catch!  I knew I saw it somewhere (I have that page amongst my
bookmarks).  Thanks (I've downloaded as well).

i *think* i've found a buglet... but am not sure....

my alpha is currently sitting in my bedroom floor as my ADSL router... the
external interface is a /26 netmask... 255.255.255.192... and it seems to
be spewing icmp packets to inappropriate places when i ping machines in
the "outside world"... outside meaning anything outside of the local ADSL
network.  somehow, packets are getting duplicated (or something) and i'm
setting off a lot of copies of blackice (something like that, perhaps not
necessarily blackice) that are inside the /26 region with me.

any thoughts?  has anyone seen this happen before??  

a couple more things- when i ping the outside world, the icmp packets i
get back claim to have received a number of corrupt bytes.  like this:

pre6? Ahh, 2.2.17 has been stable for a short while now... perhaps you
should try that then see if the problem continues?

Just a thought...

Not sure...I use my Alpha in the same capacity and have had good results
(not what you're experiencing at all).

Yeah, this is something that I fixed not too long ago.  Which ping package
do you have installed (and from which dist, woody or potato)?  I may need
to patch it if it hasn't been updated already.  There's nothing wrong with
the packets, it's just ping's brain-damage when it comes to comparing
them.

netkit-ping  0.10-3  

i ran update and a dist-upgrade about two minutes ago.  i've had that
version of ping for at least a week, i think.  i'm running unstable.

Yeah, perfect!  I'm using my SX (533MHz, 128MB RAM) for masq'ing duties as
well as the big development box.  I've got two sparcs under my feet now,
one of which I'll eventually relegate to that duty.  I also have an Indy,
a laptop, two P3's, and two Palms :-P  Basically, I have more equipment
than some university labs (and that's only the stuff that's running...I
have three more Alphas and another sparc that I haven't fired up lately).

Ok, I'll fix and submit the patch.  The original code was UGLY and poorly
written (it's amazing that it ever worked properly on ANY arch, honestly,
and I can still produce a bug on i386 if my patch isn't applied after all
of these years).

Great link. Found the Docs as well and the download is in progress. Interesting link
anyway - I wasn't aware that there was L4 on Alpha. Last time, I saw L4, the code
wasn't GPL. So this is time for me to dig around a bit more.

Anyway, thanks for saving my day, kelvin ;-)

Hi:

=A0=A0 I've installed 2.2 (potato) on my Alphastation 255. I installed th=
e =

kernel source package 2.2.17pre6 and compiled it along with the modules =

but I cannot boot it. The 'generic' kernel works fine other than no =

sound, and as well I want to remove uneeded stuff, so I re-compiled. The =

boot hangs soon (about 5 secs) after it correctly detects the stock =

Symbios 53C810a disk controller. The error is that it timed out on scsi =

target 0 and the machine is hung. I have compiled a few variations but =

no joy :(

=A0=A0 I build the source in the usual Alpha way with "make boot', make =

modules, etc. I even used the /boot/config-2.2.17-generic and only =

changed the machine type to "Avanti" and that won't boot!! It also does =

not detect the floppy controller properly either, but that's not a big =

problem as this box does not have a floppy drive...

=A0=A0 Again, I used the kernel-2.2.17pre6 package. Is this not the one t=
o =

use? Its the same as the running version. How come the "generic" binary =

works fine but the one I build does not. I have RedHack installed =

successfully on my Jensen so I am familliar with running Linux on Alpha =

and it actually work very well :-)

=A0=A0 I can provide the output from dmesg if anyone wants..

=A0=A0 Also this machine has a "Microsoft Sound System" on the motherboar=
d. =

Which module do I use for it? I've grep'ed the module source and tried =

modprobe on several but I always get the "Device or resource busy" =

error. Menuconfig lists the MSS but exactly which module does that mean??=


Thanks for any suggestions and for an excellent Linux distribution,

</Duane>

> On Sep 13, Duane Eddingfield scratched in indelible ink :

<snip bootage problems>

there are many AS255s floating around happily running linux. :)
Are you booting from the SRM console or alphabios?
if SRM, then you will need to set 'srm boot' and machine type Avanti in the
kernel 'make config'

If Alphabios, I don't know how to help you, as that was the first thing that
disappeared off mine when I got it ;)

yes this does work.  if you type 'make config' for your kenerl, select OSS
sound modules, and selesct Microsoft SOund system.
I have always compiled the support statically in  my kernels, ...  with
specified io, irq dma info.
with modules, try:
depmod mss.o io=0x520 irq=11 dma=1

or similar.  they are the options that can be specified in the kernel.
If you are booting from the srm console, also check to see that the console
knows about the sound card and has activated it.
type
>>>show device
or
>>>iconfig        (isa config)

and it should show you the io and inturrupts for the PCXBJ device -- the sound card. 
If it does _not_ show up, type:

>>>add_sound

which is an alias for a couple of isacfg commands, and that should enable the
sound subsystem.

I have someone offering me a Desktation Raptor Reflex (433MHz 21164) but the
literature says it's an NT specific machine? 
Does this mean that I cannot run linux on it, or do I just have to put up with
Alphabios (or equivelant) and milo?
I have had a quick-ish look through alphalinux.org and workstation.digital.com, but there
seems to be a minimal amount of info around.
if anyone has any experience with these machines, I would appreciate the info.

If it's based on the UX/BX board then it should run Linux. If it's a 
different board then you are probably out of luck. There is no AlphaBIOS
for these machines, they have their own proprietary ARCSBios, and the only
MILO ever done for a Deskstation board was for the UX.

FWIW, even if it's based on the UX I wouldn't buy it unless you're getting
an incredible deal. The firmware is out of date and it not getting
updated, the onboards NICs are infamous for failing to auto-negotiate.....

I second that. The UX is by far the worst piece of hardware 
I've ever had the misfortune to waste money on. It works 
with very few other devices, its BIOS is designed to run NT 
only (my hat's off to whoever got MILO to run on it: a 
pretty impressive hack).

Hi,

I have the same message as this post to the newsgroup a while ago.
Didn't seem to be a followup to the Xserver error. I just installed
2.2rev0 to an Alpha PC164LX.

additionally I get
"Fatal server error, cannot open mouse"

During the setup I chose /dev/mouse but there is no mouse device in
/dev.
XF86 setup seemed to go fine with no errors on the errror console. Is
this error just because there is no mouse device? Or are there two
errors here?

Actually I just blew away a RedHat 6.0 to upgrade to Debian :-)

This means it couldn't find your mouse.

three options:
a) ln -s /dev/psaux /dev/mouse
b) add the line
AllowMouseOpenFail 
to the Options section of /etc/X11/XF86Config
c) edit the mouse port part of /etc/X11/XF86Config to point to the
proper mouse port (/dev/psaux generally)

if it continues to crash, then there's something else wrong :(

(I tend to do both a and b, just so if my mouse dies, xdm doesn't
keep trying to spawn a dying Xserver)

> Actually I just blew away a RedHat 6.0 to upgrade to Debian :-)
Good thing to do :)

Hi,

A quick Q. 

I found the post about the boot probs on the rev0 CD's and wanted to get
rev0_CDa 
	Subject: Bootable 2.2_rev0_CDa disks now at cdimage.debian.org 
	From: Philip Hands <phil@hands.com> 
	Date: 25 Aug 2000 16:07:28 +0100 
Our mirror in Oz at Aarnet has not got this rev and nor do a few other
mirrors. I can see it at: >
http://cdimage.debian.org/cd-images/2.2_rev0_CDa/alpha/
I tried to download the image, but it requires user id/password :-(
I just need CD #1.

How can I get it? I have a friend who can burn it to CD but can't
download it.

Mike
PS. Liam, I'll try those 3 options for getting the mouse working.
Thanks for the quick reply.

No it will not run Linux. This system has ARCS BIOS (note the "S") and
cannot run Linux by itself. The Ruffian (which also has ARCS BIOS) has a
tool to load MILO (to load Linux...) that works. However the Raptors
never had this tool, Deskstation went out of business, and the needed
docs were never released AFAIK.=20

As Rich said in a previous mail, ARCS BIOS is dead and no longer being
maintained - perhaps someone should do that? There are a lot of Ruffians
out there! =20

However if you want to buy it purely for the hack value, it would be
interesting to see Linux up and going on these.=20

Ohh and another big reason not to buy it is the fact it uses True Parity
memory. That crap is EXPENSIVE! You basiclly have to sell your
car to afford some... :'(=20

HTH,
Ron

Tell me about it.  My original request was for 128MB of that stuff for my
as255, which currently only has 32.  :(  and don't talk about my car, i've
just spent AU$1500 on converting it to LPG and am still feeling broke.

If i can get if for not much more than the value of the ram in it then I will
grab it and see what hacks we can do to get it to load a milo.
If not, then I'll still have the RAM from it, and we'll see how NT runs in 32MB.
In any case, anything to decrease the ratio of poo-cees in the house must be
a good thing. We only have two alphas, three Suns (one fridge sized) one
Apollo, a NeXT cube, ..... vs a celery 350@450 and a screenless Sharp laptop
as the dialup box. oh and I must not forget the PDP11, which in a previous
life, was a TV stand.

now if only they were all mine *sigh*

Well API _was_ maintaining it for a while. I think they quit doing so
around the end of last year. Since Deskstation is dead, I would imagine
API is the only ones with rights/access to do anything with ARCS.=20

hehehe I know.. I would like to get 256MB of it, but I'm not quite ready

The only thing you might want to check is how many slots are filled in
it? That would tell you how large the SIMMs are and whether it would be
worth it just for the mem. I bet that fridge sized box keeps the house
warm! ;-)=20

Hehehe, sounds like a house I used to share.  We had a PDP11, a PDP8, 
several pee-cees, my Multia and a Cabriolet, a couple of Amigas (a 1000 and 
a 2000PC, IIRC) and about four or five Suns (IPX/IPC ... I think, whatever 
the 40 MHz flat ones are).

Not too bad for a couple of guys under 30 :)

BTW: any way to get Debian running on a Multia with an IDE drive and no floppy?

Sounds like my house: 2 P-IIIs, 1 P-75 laptop, 1 Sparcstation 10, 2 Sparc
Classics, 1 PC164SX, 1 UDB, 1 AXPpci33, and 1 SGI Indy.

Not at all.  I'm pushing 30 now, but still not bad.  I call my house "the
boneyard".

> BTW: any way to get Debian running on a Multia with an IDE drive and no floppy?

Yes, if you boot SRM, you could netboot it and install from there.  If
not, assuming you have a SCSI port in the back, you could hook up a SCSI
CD-ROM and do the install from that.

when it's turned on.  It's a Star 710/vp. Sun clone, 20MHz cpu, with vector
processor boards, probably broken, 128MB RAM, two channel scsi.  I hate to
think what it would have cost when bought new.  As it stands now, our power
bill is large wnough without turning this one on too.

No, that's my house :-P  Aside from my running machines, I have countless
motherboards, NICs, cases, etc.  My wife often wishes that we had a third
bedroom just for all of the stuff that doesn't fit into the second bedroom
(aka "the office).

hey! there's two of 'em!   I wonder if there's a concept like librarys (ref
Pratchett) where all computer heavens are linked .......
besides, computers don't die, they just stop processing.

We have a 4th room (master bedroom actually) where all the 'unused' computers
are being stored.  as well as workbenches for hacking and slashing those ones
that are feeling unhealthy.

I beg to differ, I once witnessed a motherboard commit suicide.
The NiCad cell had leaked and corroded the conductors within the
multilayer PCB. It finally shorted out the powerlines _within_
the layers of the PCB, which was some spectacular fireworks.
Yes, I happened to see it (my case is never closed, and the
speakers started making lots of noise so I ran to see what the
matter was). That was the end of my 386.

I have a spare bathroom that is slowly filling up (my "computer room"
ran out of space, both horizontal and vertical, as did the spare
bedroom).

Ummm...let me save you an email. API has never had the source to ARCSBios,
so there's nothing we can do. I think at one point Samsung may have had
the sources for the UX as they released a few updates for Y2K. As for
ever getting these out I wouldn't hold your breath. If I remember
correctly even AlphaBIOS is highly constrained by copyrights
(Microsoft). I'm sure ARCSBios is just as bad....with the addition of
a DeskStation copyright.

Hello all,

I've apt-get -b source xfree86 from
www.debian.org/~branden, and mostly it has compiled
well until...

install -m 644 debian/local/xfs.options.5
/usr/stuff/xfree86-4.0.1/debian/tmp/usr/share/man/man5
# compare manifests
(cd debian/tmp && find -type f | sort | cut -c3-) >
debian/MANIFEST.alpha.new
# confirm that the installed file list has not changed
# remove initial test once we have MANIFESTs for every
arch
[ -e debian/MANIFEST.alpha ] && cmp -s
debian/MANIFEST.alpha debian/MANIFEST.alpha.new
make: *** [debian/stampdir/install] Error 1


Anyone had a similar experience?

Rob

(no) thanks for reminding me of what I did to a 486sx25 once.  RUnning quite
happily at 50MHz (with a fan on top) till .... the damn battery ate away the
motherboard providing my friends and I a brief bit of entertainment as the
486-ina-pizza-box went on it's merry way.

What _are_ the differeneces between those two files? That appears
to be the problem; if we can see what is missing, that might help
in finding the cause.

I'm building the package(s) now to see what's going on and to try to fix
it.  Will keep everyone posted.

Hi people,

Sorry for the most obnoxious crosspost.

If anyone has a complete archive (mbox format) of any of the following
Debian mailing lists for September 2000, please contact me immediately:

debian-68k
debian-admintool
debian-alpha
debian-arm
debian-beowulf
debian-boot
debian-cd
debian-changes
debian-chinese-big5
debian-chinese-gb

debian-dpkg
debian-emacsen
debian-events-eu
debian-firewall

debian-glibc
debian-hams
debian-hppa
debian-hurd

Problem is that main archives aren't functioning[1] and web archives for
these september of these lists are incomplete.

[1] master:~debian/.forward-list-archive needs lists/procmailrc, but there's
no such file.

This was an easy one, there was no debian/MANIFEST.alpha :-P  I'm
commenting out the check so that I can make the debs and I'll mail the new
MANIFEST for alpha to Branden.

I basically fixed this (or bypassed it, really), but the packaging is
still screwed since it tries to move around the OSMesa stuff (and other
DRI stuff) that isn't built on Alpha.  I mailed Branden about it and am
waiting for his responce.  I'll keep the list posted (if you're not on the
list, I'll include you in the reply..just let me know).

Hey, so, am I completely sideways here, or is the linux file stored at:

ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/main/disks-alpha/current/jensen/linux

just NO DAMN GOOD? It seems to me that it doesn't have the AHA1754
drivers, which keeps it from being able to read the hard drive which
in turn makes it just so much dreck.

Has anyone else got it to boot? I'd be really super-surprised. Why was
the config.jensen file changed, anyways? Actually, where ARE the
config.* files in the current release?

Not looking forward to building my own kernel on a 47 Bogomips machine,

~ESP

Hi,

I've found that apacheconfig tends to destroy /etc/apache/srm.conf if ran
with an existing configuration and changing it. It gives errors, but does
so on i386 aswell, but on i386 srm.conf still works. On alpha, apache
will not start, and I get random results in the file, sometimes just a
comment (although correct), sometimes parts of what was once there and so
on. This is on potato that currently ships.

Anyone else has this problem, perhaps it's not a bug but something that
I've done wrong? It looks like that same thing happens with apache-ssl on
alpha, for me, that is. Couldn't find anything about it in the bug
database.

I compiled my own apache after reading another bug report about the
problems suexec created :)
